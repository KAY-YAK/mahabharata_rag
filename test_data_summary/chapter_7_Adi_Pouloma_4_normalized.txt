SUMMARY of Adi parva; Pouloma parva ; Chapter no :7

The text describes a curse placed upon Agni by Bhrigu, which led to Agni's withdrawal from all sacrifices. The curse was due to Agni's perceived transgression of becoming an omnivore, consuming both divine and mortal offerings. Souti recounts the events leading up to the curse and its resolution.

Agni, being a just and truthful fire deity, is perplexed by Bhrigu's accusation. He explains that he has always followed the righteous path and has been present in various forms throughout sacrifices and rituals. Agni highlights his role as the mouth of the gods and ancestors, receiving offerings and satisfying their hunger. However, he notes that this does not justify becoming an omnivore.

Agni withdraws from all sacrifices, causing widespread misery among creatures. The sages approach the gods and Brahma, seeking guidance on how to resolve the issue. The gods and sages plead with Agni to reconsider his decision, emphasizing his importance in maintaining the balance of the universe.

Brahma summons Agni and gently rebukes him for becoming deluded. He reminds Agni of his role as the creator and destroyer of worlds, urging him to act in a way that ensures the continuation of rituals and ceremonies. Brahma instructs Agni to accept only flames meant for accepting oblations, which will purify everything they touch.

Agni agrees to follow Brahma's instructions and returns to his duties, restoring balance to the universe. The gods, sages, and living beings rejoice in the resolution of the curse.
