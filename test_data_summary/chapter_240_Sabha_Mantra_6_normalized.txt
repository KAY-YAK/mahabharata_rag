SUMMARY of Sabha parva; Mantra parva ; Chapter no :240

In this passage from the Mahabharata, Yudhishthira expresses his reluctance to engage in battle against Jarasandha's forces, citing concerns about the difficulty of the task and the potential consequences of failure. He argues that without Bhima and Arjuna, who are his "eyes" and "mind," respectively, he would be left with a life devoid of purpose.

Arjuna, however, presents a counterargument, emphasizing the importance of valour and strength in achieving success. He notes that while noble lineage is valued, it is not enough on its own to guarantee victory. Instead, a kshatriya's livelihood is defined by his ability to defeat his enemies, which requires courage and valour.

Arjuna argues that all other qualities, such as mental concentration, enterprise, and fortune, are secondary to valour. He also cautions against being careless or deluded, as these traits can lead to failure and destruction. A king who wishes to achieve victory must therefore balance strength with wisdom and foresight.

The passage presents several philosophical and moral ideas explicitly. Firstly, it highlights the importance of self-reliance and personal strength in achieving success. Secondly, it suggests that noble lineage is not enough on its own to guarantee greatness, and that one must also possess qualities such as valour and mental concentration. Finally, it emphasizes the need for balance and moderation in all aspects of life.

In terms of key events and characters, this passage marks a turning point in the story, as Yudhishthira's reluctance to engage in battle against Jarasandha is challenged by Arjuna's persuasive arguments. The passage also highlights the close relationship between Yudhishthira and his brothers, particularly Arjuna, who serves as a foil to Yudhishthira's more cautious nature.

Overall, this passage provides insight into the values and ideals of ancient Indian society, highlighting the importance of strength, courage, and self-reliance in achieving success.
