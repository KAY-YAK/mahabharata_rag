SUMMARY of Adi parva; Sambhava parva ; Chapter no :86

The text is a conversation between Ashtaka and Yayati, two sages, on the path to spiritual growth and self-realization. The discussion revolves around the different types of ascetics, their lifestyles, and the means to attain success.

Yayati begins by describing the characteristics of a successful brahmachari (student) who is devoted to studying and self-control. He emphasizes the importance of living on one's own strength in the forest, giving to others without causing them pain, and being controlled in food and deeds. Yayati also distinguishes between true mendicants who do not depend on any craft for their living and those who are attached to material possessions.

Ashtaka asks about the different types of sages and those who observe vows of silence. Yayati responds by describing two types of sages: one who lives in the forest and turns his back on the village, and another who lives in the village and turns his back on the forest. He explains that a true sage who lives in the forest uses nothing from the village, whereas a sage who lives in the village gives up all desire and deeds.

Yayati also describes the characteristics of a successful ascetic, including being content with simple food, having senses under control, and being indifferent to opposites (pain and pleasure, happiness and unhappiness). He emphasizes that such an individual can conquer both this world and the supreme one.
