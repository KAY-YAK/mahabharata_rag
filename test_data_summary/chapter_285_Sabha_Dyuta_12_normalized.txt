SUMMARY of Sabha parva; Dyuta parva ; Chapter no :285

The passage describes a pivotal event in the Mahabharata, where Duryodhana, the son of Dhritarashtra, wins Droupadi, the wife of the Pandavas, in a game of dice. The story begins with Duryodhana's insolence and pride, which leads him to order his attendant, Pratikamin, to bring Droupadi to the assembly hall.

Droupadi is initially reluctant to go, citing that it is improper for a prince to stake his wife in a game. She asks Pratikamin to clarify whether Yudhishthira lost himself or her first, and when he fails to provide an answer, she sends him back to ask Yudhishthira again.

Yudhishthira remains silent, and Duryodhana suggests that Panchali Krishna come to the assembly hall to resolve the issue. Droupadi is eventually brought to the sabha, despite her protests, and is dragged by Duhshasana, who has been ordered to do so by his brother.

Throughout the passage, Droupadi's dignity and shame are repeatedly emphasized, as she is treated with disrespect and humiliation by the Kuru warriors. She appeals to their sense of dharma and morality, but her words fall on deaf ears.

The philosophical and moral ideas explicitly present in this text include:

* The importance of dharma: Droupadi emphasizes that dharma is supreme and that it should be sustained to bring peace.
* The concept of property: Bhishma's explanation highlights the ambiguity surrounding women as property, citing that they are always the property of their husbands.
* The idea of voluntary consent: Droupadi questions whether Yudhishthira chose voluntarily to stake her in the game, suggesting that he was robbed of his senses by deceitful inclinations.

The passage also highlights the themes of pride, shame, and humiliation, as well as the consequences of ignoring dharma. The characters' actions are motivated by their own interests and desires, rather than a concern for justice or morality.

Overall, this passage provides insight into the complex moral landscape of ancient Indian epic literature, highlighting the tensions between personal ambition and collective responsibility.
