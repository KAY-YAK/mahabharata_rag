Bhishma said, "O best among the Kuru lineage! In an excellent city named Mahapadma, on the southern banks
of the Ganga, there lived a brahmana who was controlled. He was amiable and was born in the lineage of the
moon. All his doubts had been dispelled and he knew the path he should pursue. He was always devoted to dharma
and had conquered anger. He was always content and had conquered his senses. He was always engaged in nonviolence. He was truthful and was revered by the virtuous. He obtained riches through proper means and through
his own efforts. His conduct was good. He possessed many relatives and kin. There were honoured friends who
sought refuge with him. He was born in a noble and great family and resorted to the best of conduct. O king! On
seeing that he had many sons, who were engaged in the extensive tasks of dharma that the family required, he
thought about a dharma that would be superior to this. He thought there were three kinds of dharma-that spoken
about in the Vedas, that laid down in the sacred texts[Other than the Vedas. A distinction is presumably being drawn between shruti and smriti.] and the dharma practised by virtuous people. Which are
the auspicious tasks that I should perform? What will bring benefit? What should I resort to? He always thought
about such things and could never arrive at a conclusion. While he thus reflected on dharma, a guest arrived at his
house. He was also an extremely controlled brahmana and was devoted to the supreme. He honoured him well, in
accordance  with  the  proper  rites  that  have  been  laid  down.  When  he  was  rested  and  seated,  he  spoke  these
words[That is, the host addressed the guest.]."'
