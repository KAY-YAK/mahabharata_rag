Janamejaya said, 'O Brahmana! After killing the demon named Baka, what did the Pandavas, those tigers among
men, do?'

Vaishampayana said, 'O king! After killing the demon named Baka, they lived in the house of that Brahmana,
engaging themselves in studies about the supreme brahman. A few days later, a Brahmana who was rigid in the
practice of his vows came to live in that Brahmana's house. That learned bull among Brahmanas, always hospitable towards guests, duly worshipped him and gave him a place to live in his house. Then those bulls among
men, the Pandavas, and Kunti, requested the Brahmana to tell them about his wonderful experiences. He told them
about many countries, places of pilgrimage, rivers, many kings and many wonderful cities.

'O Janamejaya! When these accounts were over, the Brahmana told them about the wonderful svayamvara[Ceremony where the bride chooses her own groom. He told them that the svayamvara was being planned.] of
Yajnasena's[Yajnasena is one of Drupada's names.] daughter in the land of Panchala and the births of Dhrishtadyumna and Shikhandi and also that of
Krishna[Droupadi.], who was born from Drupada's great sacrifice and not from any woman's womb. Hearing of these wonderful events that had happened in this world, those bulls among men[The Pandavas.] asked the great-souled one[The visiting Brahmana.] to narrate these
accounts in greater detail. "How did Drupada's son, Dhrishtadyumna's birth take place from the fire? How did
Krishna's wonderful birth take place from the middle of the altar? How did he[Dhrishtadyumna.] learn the usage of all weapons
from the great archer Drona? How did the great friendship between those two[Drona and Drupada.] break up?" O king! Having been
thus asked by those bulls among men, the Brahmana recounted in detail the story of Droupadi's birth.'
