'Dhritarashtra said, "Indeed, that was a great sorrow, to dwell in such difficult circumstances. How could he have found pleasure there? O supreme
among eloquent ones! How could he have been satisfied there? How can
one dwell in a place where one faces a contravention of dharma[There is a contravention because in that difficult situation, the brahmana
cannot pursue the usual dictates of dharma.]? How can
that man escape from this great fear? Tell me everything about this and I
will try to do what is right. Great compassion is generated in me and I wish
to save him from that state."

'Vidura replied, "O king! That was only a metaphor, cited by those who
know about salvation. Using it, a man can enjoy a good end in the world of
the hereafter. That desolate forest is the unfathomable cycle of life. The carnivorous beasts that were mentioned are diseases. A woman, giant in form,
was established there. The wise speak of her as old age, destructive of complexion and beauty. O king! The well is the body that souls occupy. The giant serpent which dwells there is time. He is the destroyer of all beings and
takes away everything from the body. In the midst of that well there was a
creeper there and the man hung onto it. That is the hope for remaining alive,
which all those with bodies possess. O king! The elephant with six faces is
said to be the year. Its faces are said to be the seasons and its feet are the
months. Those who think about beings say that the rats which are always
gnawing at the tree are days and nights[Hence black and white.]. The bees there are said to be desire. From it, there are many flows that stream down as honey. Humans submerge themselves in those juices of desire. Those who are learned say that
the wheel of life circles in this way. That is the reason wise ones sever the
noose that ties them to the wheel of life."'
