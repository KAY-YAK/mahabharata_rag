'Yudhishthira asked, "Tell me about what is auspicious, brings great happiness, is without violence and is revered by the worlds. What can bring dharma and happiness and also lead to happiness for those like me?"

'Bhishma replied, "O lord! Those four ashramas have been laid down for
brahmanas. O supreme among the Bharata lineage! The other three varnas
also follow them. O king! There are many tasks that have been indicated for
kings who wish to attain heaven. But what has been indicated in the sacred
texts is not a mere list of examples. It is recommended that all kshatriyas
should follow this. A brahmana who follows the conduct of kshatriyas,
vaishyas or shudras is regarded as evil in intelligence and censured in this
world. He goes to hell in the next world. O Pandava! People give a brahmana who is engaged in wrong tasks names identified with slaves, dogs,
wolves and animals. A brahmana who is engaged in the six tasks, follows
all the dharmas in the four ashramas, is controlled and has cleansed his soul,
is pure and engaged in austerities and is without desire-is spoken of as
having obtained the eternal worlds. Whatever tasks a person performs, in
whatever form and in whichever place, the qualities that he obtains are exactly proportionate to that. O Indra among kings! You should know that the
prosperity associated with studying is reckoned to be greater than that obtained through agriculture, trade and animal husbandry. Destiny is driven by
time. Everything is determined by the progress of destiny. Under its subjugation, superior, middling and inferior tasks are performed. Some earlier
beneficial deeds come to an end[Beneficial deeds in earlier lives, when their fruits are exhausted.]. In every direction in the world, it is the
brahman who is always engaged in its work."'
