'Yudhishthira said, "As you have spoken, I have not obtained enough of this
amrita. O grandfather! Therefore, speak to me again about dharma."

'Bhishma replied, "On this, an ancient history is recounted about a conversation between Goutama and the great-souled Yama. Goutama's great
hermitage was on Mount Pariyatra and Goutama dwelt there for some time.
Listen to this. Goutama tormented himself through austerities for sixty
thousand years. The cleansed and ascetic sage performed severe austerities.
O tiger among men! Yama, the guardian of the world, went to him there. As
sage Goutama performed those excellent austerities, he looked at the rishi.
Because of his energy, the brahmana rishi realized that Yama had arrived.
The one who was rich in austerities joined his hands in salutation and advanced towards him. Dharmaraja[Yama.] looked towards that bull among men
and bowed down before him. Dharma asked him, 'What can I do for you?'

Goutama asked, 'How can one free oneself of the debts due to the mother
and the father? How can a man quickly obtain the auspicious worlds, which
are so difficult to obtain?' Yama replied, 'Austerities, purity, constant devotion to truth and dharma, constant worship of the mother and the father are
the tasks one should be attached to. One must perform many horse sacrifices, with dakshina for the officiating priests. A man will then obtain
worlds that are extraordinary to behold.'"'
