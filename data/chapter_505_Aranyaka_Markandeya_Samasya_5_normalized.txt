'Markandeya said, "O extender of the Kuru lineage! Brahma's third son had Apava's daughter as a wife[Brahma had sons through his mental powers and the third of these was Angiras. Apava is Vasishtha's name.
Angiras had several wives, one of whom was named Subha. However, none of these was Vasishtha's daughter. It is
possible that the critical edition has got this wrong. For instance, instead of Apava's daughter, some other versions
say that Angiras had a wife named Subha and this fits better.]. O
king! Listen to the account of his offspring-Brihajjyoti, Brihatkirti, Brihadbrahma, Brihanmana, Brihanmantra,
Brihadbhasa and Brihaspati. The first daughter of Angiras was the goddess Bhanumati. Among all his offspring,
she was unmatched in beauty. Angiras's second daughter was named Raga. She was loved by all beings and that
was the reason she was known as Raga[Raga means love, passion, affection.]. Angiras's third daughter was Sinivali. Her form was thin and her body
was sometimes seen and sometimes not seen. So it was said that she was like Kapardin's daughter[Sinivali is the day preceding the new moon and the moon's crescent is so thin that it can hardly be seen. Kapardin is Shiva's daughter. It is not clear who is Shiva's daughter. Nothing fits well enough.]. Then
Archismati was seen with her radiance and Havismati with her oblations. Angiras's sixth sacred daughter was
named Mahishmati. The seventh of Angiras's daughters was Mahamati. She was radiant and was honoured at great
sacrifices. This seventh daughter, Mahamati, was renowned. On seeing another immensely fortunate daughter, people wonderingly exclaimed that she was one and could not be divided. She was given the name of Kuhu[Kuhu is the day of the new moon, when the moon is invisible. Because the moon is invisible, it cannot be
divided into parts.]."'
