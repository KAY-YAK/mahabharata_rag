Vaishampayana said, 'When thirty-six years had passed, Yudhishthira, descendant of the Kuru lineage, saw contrary portents. Rough and violent winds began to blow, showering stones. Birds began to circle around on the
left[The left is inauspicious.]. The giant rivers retraced their courses. The directions were covered in mist. From the sky, meteors showered
down on the ground, with blazing coals. O king! The solar disc was covered in dust. When it arose, the sun always
seemed to be without any rays and headless torsos could be seen in it. The sun and the moon were seen to be enveloped in terrible circles. These had three colours, black and rough at the extremities and with red and hues like
ash elsewhere. There were many other omens, signifying fear and terror. O king! These could be seen continuously
and caused anxiety in the minds. After some time, Yudhishthira, king of the Kurus, heard of the carnage that had
occurred among the Vrishnis because of the clubs. Pandava heard that only Vasudeva and Rama[Balarama.] had escaped. He
summoned his brothers, to discuss what should be done. Having heard that the Vrishnis had been destroyed because of the force of the brahmana's staff[A brahmana's curse. In a broader sense, this also means destiny.], the Pandavas were distressed and consulted each other. The brave ones
could not believe the death of Vasudeva, the wielder of the Sharnga bow[Sharnga is the name of Vishnu's (Krishna's) bow, made out of horn.]. It was like the drying up of the ocean.
Hearing about the incident with the clubs, they were overcome by sorrow and grief. Distressed and devoid of resolution, the Pandavas sat down.'
