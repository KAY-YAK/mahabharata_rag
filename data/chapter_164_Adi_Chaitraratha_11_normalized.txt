Vaishampayana said, 'Hearing the gandharva's words, the bull of the Bharata lineage, Arjuna, shone with joy, like
the full moon. His curiosity was excited by what he had heard about Vashishtha's ascetic powers. The best of the
Kurus, the great archer, spoke to the gandharva, "I wish to hear the story of the rishi whom you have referred to as
Vashishtha. Tell me in detail. O lord of the gandharvas! Tell me who this illustrious rishi, the priest of our ancestors, was."

'The gandharva said, "Desire and anger, which even the gods find difficult to conquer, were overcome through
his[Vashishtha's.] austerities and washed his feet. Though the supreme sage's wrath was stirred at Vishvamitra's evil deed, he
was noble enough not to annihilate the Kushikas[Vishvamitra and his sons are known as the Kushikas. Kushika was Vishvamitra's grandfather. According to
some accounts, Kushika was Vishvamitra's father.]. Though he mourned the death of his sons, and had the power
to do so, he did not perform any terrible deed to destroy Vishvamitra. Like the great ocean does not cross its shoreline, he did not transgress Yama's law by bringing his sons back from the land of the dead. Obtaining this great-
souled and self-controlled supreme rishi Vashishtha as their priest, Ikshvaku and other kings conquered the entire
earth. O descendant of the Kuru lineage! These kings performed many sacrifices. O best of the Pandavas! This
brahmarshi was the priest for those excellent kings, like Brihaspati was for the gods.

'"Therefore, look for a Brahmana in whose heart dharma is supreme, who is learned in the Vedas and in dharma
and who has all the qualities, and appoint him as your priest. O Partha! A Kshatriya of noble birth who wishes to
conquer the earth must first appoint a priest to be in front, so that the kingdom flourishes. A king who wishes to
conquer the earth must have a Brahmana before him. Therefore, let a Brahmana who has all the qualities be your
priest."'
