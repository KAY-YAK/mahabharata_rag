Vaishampayana said, 'Having obtained the kingdom, the immensely wise Yudhishthira was consecrated. The pure
one[Probably suggesting that the period of mourning is over.] joined his hands in salutation and spoke to Dasharha Pundarikaksha. "O Krishna! O tiger among the Yadu
lineage! It is through your favours, your strength, your intelligence and your valour that this kingdom of my father
and grandfather has again been conveyed to me. O Pundarikaksha! O scorcher of enemies! I repeatedly bow down
before you. You have been spoken of as the only man. You are the lord of the Satvatas[Yadavas.]. I bow down before you.
The supreme rishis have praised you under many names[Obviously, such a numbering is not given in the text. We have given it to suggest the idea that it must have
been the intention to mention 100 of Krishna's names. In the listing we have given, it falls short at ninety-five.
But that's also because it is not always clear what should be included. For example, should lord of the Satvatas
also be included in the numbered list? How about Pundarikaksha? The translations of the names have not been
given in the obvious instances.]-(1) Vishvakarma[Creator of the universe.]; (2) Vishvatma[Soul of the universe.]; (3) Vishvasambhava[The origin of the universe.]; (4) Vishnu; (5) Jishnu; (6) Hari; (7) Krishna; (8) Vaikuntha; (9) Purushottama; (10) Aditya, since
in ancient times, you were in her womb for seven nights[This causes problems of interpretation. The Puranas speak of Vishnu having been born in Aditi's womb on seven occasions. However, the text here clearly says nights, not occasions. Vishnu is one of the Adityas and is Aditi's son. As vamana (dwarf) incarnation, Vishnu was specifically Aditi's son. In addition, Devaki, Krishna's
mother, was an incarnation of Aditi. In all probability, this refers to the seven sons of Devaki, the first six having
been killed by Kamsa.]; (11) Prishnigarbha, one who is spoken of as having
been born in different forms in the three yugas[Four of Vishnu's incarnations in satya yuga, three in treta yuga and two in dvapara yuga.]; (12) Shuchishrava[Someone who is heard of as being pure.]; (13) Hrishikesha[Lord of the senses.]; (14) Ghritarchi[Someone to whom offerings of clarified butter are made.] is

Ruksha[The harsh one.]; (70) Rukma; (71) Sushena; (72) Dundubhi; (73) Gabhastinemi[One whose axle radiates light.]; (74) Shripadma; (75) Pushkara; (76)
Pushpadharana; (77) Ribhu; (78) Vibhu; (79) Sarvasukshma[One who is the subtlety in everything.]; (80) Savitra; (81) Ambhanidhi[The store of waters.]; (82) Brahma;

Having been thus praised in the midst of the assembly hall by the eldest Pandava, the eloquent Krishna Pundarikaksha, foremost among the Yadavas, spoke words to delight the descendant of the Bharata lineage.'
