Vaishampayana said, 'Then Duryodhana, Karna, Duhshasana, Vivimshati, Drona and his son, and Kripa who was
an atiratha in battle, returned angrily to the battle again, wishing to cause violence to Dhananjaya. They drew their
sturdy and powerful bows. O great king! The one with the monkey on his banner[Arjuna.] went forward to meet them on
a chariot that was as radiant as the sun, with his flag unfurled. Kripa, Karna and Drona, supreme among charioteers, immensely valorous and with great weapons, sought to repulse Dhananjaya. They released a flood of arrows,
like rain from monsoon clouds. A shower of arrows descended on Kiriti. They stationed themselves nearby and
with great determination in that field of battle, swiftly showered him with many arrows that possessed feathered
shafts. Having been thus covered from every direction with divine weapons, not even a space of two fingers could
be seen on him. But maharatha Bibhatsu laughed and fixed his divine Aindra[Named after Indra.] weapon on Gandiva. It was as radiant as the sun. In that battle, the diademed and powerful Kounteya covered all the Kurus with arrows that burnt
like the rays of the sun. Gandiva was like lightning in the clouds, like fire in the mountains and as long as Indra's
weapon[Indra's weapon (bow) is the rainbow.]. It was like Parjanya's showers and like lightning in the sky. Like a bird, Gandiva enveloped the ten directions. All the charioteers were completely terrified and sought peace. They were bereft of their senses. Losing
their consciousness, all the warriors lost heart in the battle. O bull among the Bharata lineage! Thus, all the soldiers
were shattered and fled in all the directions. They lost hope that they would remain alive.'
