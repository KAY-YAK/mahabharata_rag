'Yudhishthira said, "O grandfather! Because of my greed for the kingdom,
sons, grandsons, brothers, fathers, fathers-in-law, preceptors, maternal uncles, grandfathers, great-souled kshatriyas, kin, well-wishers, friends, relatives and many kings who had assembled from many countries have been
slain. O grandfather! They have been killed by me alone. O one rich in austerities! Those lords of the earth were always established in dharma. They
performed good deeds and drank soma. Having caused such people to be
killed, what will I obtain? Thinking repeatedly about this, I am incessantly
being burnt. Those kings were prosperous and like lions. The earth is without them now. O grandfather! On seeing this terrible slaughter of relatives,
the slaying of hundreds of the enemy and other men in crores, I am being
tormented. What will be the plight of those beautiful women? They have
been deprived of their sons, husbands and brothers. They are wan and distressed and are falling down on the surface of the ground. They are censuring us, the Pandavas and the Vrishnis, as the perpetrators of terrible deeds.
On seeing their fathers, brothers, husbands and sons, all those women are
ready to give up their beloved lives and go to Yama's eternal abode. O best
among brahmanas! They are driven by affection. I have no doubt about this.
It is evident that because of the subtlety of dharma, we will become the
slayers of women. We committed an eternal sin by killing our well-wishers.
We will be cast into hell, with our heads hanging downwards. O supreme
one! We will perform terrible austerities and free ourselves of our bodies. O
grandfather! In particular, tell me about the state of life I should resort to
now."'
