'Bhishma said, "When the fowler had left, the miserable she-pigeon remembered its husband. It became senseless with grief and wept. It lamented
in sorrow. 'O beloved! I cannot remember a single instance of your having
acted in an unpleasant way. O bird! Even when a spirited woman possesses
many sons, when she becomes a widow and is bereft of her husband, her
relatives grieve for her. I have always been loved by you and have been
comforted and greatly revered by sweet, pleasant and agreeable words. We
have sported in valleys, mountains, rivers and springs. O beloved one! We
have pleasured in the delightful tops of trees. I have found delight with you,
happily roaming through the sky. O beloved one! I have sported with you.
Where has all that gone now? What a father gives is limited. What a mother
gives is limited. What a son gives is limited. What a husband gives is unlimited and who will not worship him. There is no protector like a husband.
There is no happiness like a husband. Abandoning all riches, husbands are
the refuges of women. O lord! Without you, there is no point to remaining
alive. Which virtuous woman will be interested in remaining alive, if she is
without her husband?' Extremely miserable, it lamented piteously in many
ways. Devoted to its husband, it entered the blazing fire. And there it saw its
husband, attired in colourful garments, astride a celestial vehicle and honoured by great-souled ones who had performed good deeds. It was adorned
in colourful garlands and garments and was decorated with every kind of
ornament. It was surrounded by the performers of auspicious deeds, astride
hundreds of crores of celestial vehicles. The bird had gone to heaven and
was joined by its wife. It was worshipped because of its deeds and found
pleasure there with its wife."'
