'Drupada said, "O greatly learned Vidura! It is indeed as you have told me now. O lord! I am also greatly delighted
at the alliance that we have just concluded. It is proper that these great-souled brothers should now return home.
But it is not proper that I should say this myself, in my own words. If that is what the brave Yudhishthira, son of
Kunti, Bhimasena and Arjuna, the twins[Nakula and Sahadeva.], who are bulls among men, and Rama[Balarama.] and Krishna, learned in the precepts of the law, desire, then the Pandavas should go there. Those two tigers among men[Balarama and Krishna.] are always engaged in
that which is good for them[The Pandavas.]."
'Yudhishthira said, "O king! My followers and I are now dependent on you. We will do that which you tell us is
for our own good."'

Vaishampayana said, 'At that, Vasudeva said, "I am of the view that they should go. But we must go by what
King Drupada, who knows everything about the law, suggests." Drupada replied, "Having thought about all the
circumstances, my views are in agreement with what the mighty-armed and valiant Dasharha[Krishna.], supreme among
men, thinks. The time is right. There is no doubt that the greatly fortunate sons of Kunti, the sons of Pandu, are
now as dear to me as they are to Vasudeva himself. Yudhishthira, Kunti's son and the son of Dharma, himself does
not seek their welfare as much as Keshava, tiger among men, does." Then the great-souled Drupada gave them
leave to depart. The Pandavas, Krishna and the extremely wise Vidura took with them Droupadi Krishna and the
illustrious Kunti, and with pleasure and a leisurely pace, travelled towards the city of Hastinapura[The word used here for Hastinapura is Nagasahrya.].

'O descendant of the Bharata lineage! On hearing that the warriors were coming, Kourava Dhritarashtra sent the
Kouravas to receive the Pandavas-the great archer Vikarna, Chitrasena, the supreme archer Drona and Kripa, the
son of Goutama. Then, surrounded by them, the maharatha and radiant warriors slowly entered the city of Hastinapura, their resplendence increasing. Those tigers among men were freed from their grief and sorrow. The city became radiant with wonder. Dear to the hearts of the people, the Pandavas heard loud exclamations from the citizens, always eager to do what was dear to them[The Pandavas.]. "The tiger among men, the one of righteous conduct[Yudhishthira.], has returned. He always protected us with the rule of law, as if we were his near relatives. It seems without doubt as if
the great King Pandu, who loved the forest, has returned today from the forest, to do that which pleases us and is
good for our welfare. Can there be any greater joy for us, now that the brave sons of Kunti have returned to the
city? If we have given alms and sacrificial offerings, if we have performed austerities, let the Pandavas remain in
the city for a hundred autumns." They[The Pandavas.] worshipped the feet of Dhritarashtra, Bhishma and others who deserved it,
and asking about the welfare of everyone in the city, entered the place earmarked for them at Dhritarashtra's
command.

'When those immensely strong and great souls had rested for some time, they were summoned by King Dhritarashtra and the son of Shantanu[Bhishma.]. Dhritarashtra said, "O son of Kunti[Yudhishthira.]! Listen with your brothers to what I
have to say. So that strife does not arise again, go to Khandavaprastha. No one can harm you there, if you are protected there by Partha, as the thirty gods are by the wielder of the vajra[Indra.]. Go to Khandavaprastha and take half the
kingdom." Those bulls among men accepted the king's words and saluting everyone set out for that terrible forest.
Having received half the kingdom, they entered Khandavaprastha.

'With Krishna leading them, the invincible Pandavas went there and made it as beautiful a place as heaven. Led
by Dvaipayana, the maharathas selected a pure and holy place, performed propitiatory ceremonies and measured
out the land for a city. It was surrounded by moats as wide as the ocean and walls that rose high up into the sky. It
was white like the clouds and like snow-covered mountains. This greatest of cities was as resplendent as
Bhogavati[The capital of the nagas.] of the nagas. It was protected by terrible double-doored gates that were like two-winged Garudas.
The high towers were like dense clouds, like many Mandara mountains. It was well covered with many weapons,
with sharp spears and javelins like double-tongued snakes and impenetrable to the weapons of enemies. The splendid and spiralling turrets were guarded by warriors and well stocked with weapons of attack. There were many
sharp hooks and shataghnis[Weapons that could kill a hundred warriors at a time.] and other weapons of war. Great iron chakras adorned that best of cities. The streets
were wide and well laid out, preventing collisions among large chariots. It shone with many beautiful white mansions. Like a mass of dense clouds circled by lightning and reflecting the image of heaven, it came to be known as
Indraprastha.

'"In that lovely and beautiful place was the dwelling of the Kouravas[The Pandavas were also descended from Kuru.]. It was full of every kind of treasure,
like the palace of the treasurer[Kubera.] himself. O king! Brahmanas, the best of those who knew all the Vedas, went
there. It was a desired habitation for those who knew all the tongues. Desiring to earn wealth, many merchants
from every direction went there. Desirous of living there, came many artisans of every craft. Lovely gardens surrounded the city, with amras[Mango trees.],amratakas[Hog plums.],nipas[The kadamba tree.],
ashokas[Tree with red blossoms.],champakas[Tree with yellow fragrant flowers.],punnagas[Variety of tree, another name for the champaka.],nagapushpas[Variety of champaka.],lakuchas[Breadfruit tree.],panasas[Breadfruit tree.], shalas[A tall tree.],talas[Palm tree.],kadambas[Fragrant tree that buds at the time of rains.],baku-
las[Tree with fragrant flowers.] and ketakas[Tree with fragrant flowers.]. These trees were beautiful, full of flowers, and bent down with the burden of their fruit. Amlokas[Myrobalan.],lodhras[Tree with red or white flowers.], blossoming ankolas[Name of a tree.],jambus[Rose apple.],patalas[The red trumpet flower.],kubjakas[Name of a tree.],atimuktakas[Creeper that surrounds mango trees.],karaviras[Oleanders.],parijatas[Coral tree.]
and many other kinds of trees were there, always adorned with flowers and fruit and swarming with many different
kinds of birds. There echoed the calls of frenzied peacocks and delighted cuckoos. There were houses that were as
white as mirrors and bowers full of creepers. There were artificial hillocks designed to bring pleasure. There were
ponds filled with clear water and charming lakes that were fragrant with lotuses and water lilies and adorned with
many swans, geese and chakravaka[The ruddy goose.] birds. The beautiful ponds were surrounded by many trees and there were
many beautiful and large tanks.

'O great king! Living in that large kingdom populated by holy people, the joy of the Pandavas continued to increase eternally. Thus, because of the righteous conduct of Bhishma and the king[Dhritarashtra.], the Pandavas came to live in
Khandavaprastha. With the five great archers[The Pandavas.], each like an Indra, that best of cities was adorned like Bhogavati
of the nagas. O king! Having settled them there and taking the consent of the Pandavas, the brave Keshava, with
Rama[Balarama.], then went to Dvaravati[Dwaraka or Dwarika, in today's Gujarat. Sometimes, Dvarvati is used instead of Dvaravati. Literally, the
place with gates or doors.
