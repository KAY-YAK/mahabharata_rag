Vasudeva said, "O father[The word used is tata.]! O Yudhishthira! The brahmana rishi[Upamanyu.] controlled himself. He joined his hands in
salutation and told me those names, starting at the beginning.

'"Upamanyu said, 'I will satisfy Sthanu through these names, famous in all the worlds. Some were spoken of by
Brahma and the rishis. Others are in the Vedas and the Vedangas. These are great names and uttered by those who
are truthful, ensure success in every kind of endeavour. Having cleansed his soul, the rishi Tandi devotedly used
these names for the god. These names, famous in the worlds, have been uttered by sages who know about the truth.
He is supreme. He is the foremost. He is heaven. He is the one who is engaged in the welfare of all beings. These
names have been heard everywhere in the universe and open up entry into Brahma's world. This is the supreme
and eternal mystery that Brahma spoke about earlier. O best among the Yadu lineage! I will tell you. Listen with
single-minded attention. You are devoted to the supreme god Bhava, Parameshvara. Therefore, listen to what the
eternal Brahma said. Even if one tried for one hundred years, one is incapable of speaking about Sharva's powers
in entirety and detail. Even the gods are incapable of comprehending his beginning, middle and end. O Madhava!
Therefore, who is capable of speaking about all his qualities? Who is capable of speaking about that god's greatness of conduct? Through his favours, I will use phrases and syllables to touch on it briefly. Without his blessings,
one can neither obtain nor praise the lord. Since I have been granted permission by him, I always praise Bhava.
The great-souled one is without beginning and without end. He is the origin of everything. His own origin is unmanifest. I will tell you about some names that have been used for him. He is the granter of boons. He is the one to
be revered. The intelligent one's form is the universe. Listen to the names that were used for him by the one who
was born from the lotus[Brahma.]. The great grandfather spoke of ten thousand names. Like clarified butter being churned
out of curds, I will use my mind to churn names from those. Gold represents the essence of the mountains. Honey
represents the essence of flowers. Cream represents the essence of clarified butter. This essence has been extracted
like that. It cleanses all kinds of sins and is in conformity with the four Vedas. They need to be studied carefully
and remembered with clean souls. They grant tranquility and benefit. They are great and auspicious and destroy
rakshasas[These rakshasas may also be metaphorical, as in vices.]. They should be told to devotees, those who are faithful and believers. They should not be told to
those who are not devoted, have not cleansed their souls and are non-believers. The god who is the wielder of
Pinaka is in all atmans. O Krishna! If a person hates him, he will go to hell, with his ancestors and his descendants.
This[The list of names.] represents meditation. This represents knowledge. This is the supreme mystery. If one gets to know them at
the time of death, one goes to the supreme destination. This is sacred, auspicious, pure and supremely beneficial. O
mighty-armed one! Recite these names. This is the best chant among all chants of praise. In ancient times, Brahma,
the grandfather of all the worlds, composed these. He thought of it as the divine king of all chants. Since that time,
this praise to the great-souled lord has been famous in the universe and has been revered by the immortals. This
king of hymns descended from Brahma's world. In ancient times, he recited it to Tandi and it is therefore thought
of as something composed by Tandi. It was Tandi who brought it down from heaven to earth. It is the most auspicious among all things that are auspicious. It is destructive of all sins. O mighty-armed one! I will recite this hymn,
which is supreme among all hymns. It is about the one who is the brahmana among all brahmanas, supreme among
all things supreme, energy among all kinds of energy and austerity among all types of austerities. He  is peace
among all kinds of peace, resplendence among all kinds of resplendence, restraint among all kinds of restraint, intelligence among all kinds of intelligence, god among all kinds of gods, sage among all kinds of sages, sacrifice
among all kinds of sacrifice, auspicious among all things auspicious, Rudra among all the Rudras, the lord among
all lords, the yogi among all yogis and the cause among all causes. All the worlds originate from him and merge
into him when they no longer have existence. He is in the atman of all beings. He is the infinitely energetic Hara.
Hear Sharva's one thousand and eight names. O best among men! If you listen to them, you will be successful in
all your desires.

'"'Since you are the foremost and illustrious one, I have praised you with devotion. Brahma and the other gods
and learned maharshis praise, worship and honour you. Who can satisfy the lord of the universe? However, because of my devotion, I have placed that prosperous lord of sacrifices at the forefront. Having obtained his permission, I have praised that supreme among intelligent ones. These names of Shiva enhance prosperity. If one is always pure and uses these to praise the god, one obtains the atman inside one's own atman[Obtains the brahman inside one's own atman.]. Svayambhu himself
chanted these as a means towards the supreme brahman. The rishis and the gods subsequently chanted these. When
he is thus praised, Mahadeva is himself pleased. Compassionate towards his devotees, the illustrious one comforts
them. The foremost among men are believers and faithful and praise him across several births. Whether they are
asleep, awake or wandering along different paths, they praise the one who should be praised and are content and
delighted. They do this in thousands of crores of births and in many wombs of the cycle of life. When all the sins
have been cleansed in a creature, devotion towards Bhava is created. That devotion towards Bhava is also created
by him and by no one else. He is the reason behind the emancipation of everyone. This god is extremely difficult to
obtain. It is rare to find single-minded, unobstructed and unwavering devotion towards Rudra among men. It is
only through his favours that men obtain such faith. When their consciousness is overcome by such sentiments,
they advance towards the supreme end. When men are overcome by such supreme sentiments in every way, the
god becomes gracious towards them and saves them from this cycle of life. I think that other gods, with the exception of Mahadeva, do not wish that men should use the strength of their austerities to be freed from the cycle of
life[Other gods do not desire that men should become like gods, using the power of their austerities.].

'"'O Krishna[This is Upamanyu speaking now.]! Tandi was pure in his intelligence and was Indra's equal. Thus did he praise the illustrious
Krittivasa, the lord of officiating priests. Illustrious Brahma himself chanted this praise. Brahma recounted it to
Shakra and Shakra recounted it to Mrityu. Mrityu recounted it to the Rudras and the Rudras presented it to Tandi.
Through great austerities, Tandi obtained it in Brahma's abode. Tandi recounted it to Shukra and Bhargava[Descended from Bhrigu's lineage, meaning Shukra.] recounted it to Goutama. O  Madhava! Goutama  told  Vaivasvata  Manu  about  it.  The  intelligent  Manu  instructed
Narayana  and  the  Sadhyas.  Achyuta  Narayana  and  the  illustrious  Sadhyas  told  Yama  about  it.  The  illustrious
Vaivasvata Yama told Nachiketa. O Varshneya! Nachiketa told Markandeya about it. O Janardana! Following the
proper rituals, I obtained it from Markandeya. O slayer of enemies! I have now given this famous chant to you, and
heaven, freedom from disease, a long life, riches and strength can be obtained through it. The danavas, yakshas,
rakshasas, pishachas, yatudhanas, guhyakas and serpents cause no obstructions for such a person. If a person is
pure, follows brahmacharya, is in control of his senses and reads this continuously for an entire year, he obtains the
fruits of a horse sacrifice.'"'
