Vaishampayana said, 'Then princess Droupadi replied to the question that the foremost of the Shibis[Kotikashya is the king of Shibi.] had asked.
She glanced gently and let go off the branch. She gathered her silken upper garment and replied, "O son of a king!
I know in my heart that it is not proper for someone like me to address you thus. But there is no other man or
woman here who can reply to your question. O fortunate one! I am alone here and must therefore, give my own
reply. Listen. I am alone in this forest. Being always devoted to my own dharma, how can I speak to you then? I
know that you are the son of Suratha and that men know you by the name of Kotikashya. O Shaibya! Therefore, I
will tell you about my relatives[And not spend any more time in conversation.]. Listen. O Shaibya! I am the daughter of King Drupada and men know me as
Krishna. I have chosen five men to be my husbands. You may have heard of them, since they come from Khandavaprastha. They are Yudhishthira, Bhima, Arjuna and the two brave sons of Madri. The Parthas have left me
here and have left in the four directions to hunt. The king[Yudhishthira.] has gone east, Bhimasena south, Jaya[Jaya is Arjuna's name.] west and the
twins to the north. I think that the time has come for those great charioteers to return. Depart after they have honoured you. Descend and unyoke your steeds. The great-souled son of Dharma loves guests and will be delighted to
see you here." Having thus spoken to Shaibya's son, Drupada's moon-faced daughter thought of the dharma of attending to guests and entered the extensive cottage, made out of leaves.'
