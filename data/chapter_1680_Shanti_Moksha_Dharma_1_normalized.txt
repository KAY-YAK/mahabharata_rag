The brahmana said, 'O supreme among serpents! There is no doubt that this is extraordinary. I am extremely
delighted. Your sentences are full of meaning and have shown me my path. O virtuous one! O supreme
among serpents! May you be fortunate. I will depart. Remember me and send your messengers to find out how I
am.'

'"The serpent replied, 'You have not told me about the task that you are attached to. How can you then go? O
brahmana! Tell me what is to be done and the reason why you have come here. O bull among brahmanas! Whether
you state it or don't state it, take my permission and leave only after you have accomplished your purpose. O brahmana! You should only go after you have honoured me and received my permission. I have become attached to
you. You should not go only after having seen me, seated near the root of this tree. O brahmana rishi! This is not
how you should depart. O foremost among brahmanas! There is no doubt that you have also become attached to
me. O unblemished one! All these people belong to you. In staying with me, what is there to think about?'

'"The brahmana said, 'O immensely wise one! O serpent! It is exactly as you have understood it. The gods are
not superior to you in any way. O serpent! I am you and you are me. I, you, and all the creatures can always go
everywhere[Everyone is part of the universal brahman.]. O lord of Bhoga[Bhogavati is the capital city of the serpents.]! There was a doubt in my mind about the way to accumulate merit. O virtuous
one! I have now seen the truth and will follow the vow of unchha. O virtuous one! I have now made up my mind to
follow the best method. O fortunate one! O serpent! I have obtained success and I seek your leave.'"'
