Brahma said, "From the unmanifest, the immensely intelligent Mahat was generated first. This is the origin
of all the qualities and is known as the first creation. Mahat is also known as the great soul, intelligence,
Vishnu, Vishva, the valiant Shambhu, understanding, wisdom, realization, fame, fortitude and memory. Progressively, Mahat is thought of in these different words. A learned brahmana who knows this is not immersed in confusion. His arms and feet are in every direction. His eyes, heads and faces are in every direction. His ears are everywhere in the worlds. He is established, pervading everything. With the attributes of greatness, power and radiance,
Purusha is based in the heart of everything. He is the lord of being minute, being light and obtaining everything[The siddhis again.].
He is resplendent and without decay. There are intelligent people in the world who are devoted to renunciation.
They meditate and always immerse themselves in yoga. They are devoted to the truth and conquer their senses.
They are learned, without greed and have conquered anger. They are patient and cheerful in their minds. They are
without a sense of ownership and without a sense of ego. They are free in every possible way and obtain Mahat.
Those who perceive Mahat in their own atmans go to the supreme and auspicious destination. Among all the people, they are patient and are not submerged in confusion. Svayambhu Vishnu is himself the lord of that first creation. This is the ancient lord, Purusha. He is hidden in a cave and the universe is his form. He is golden and is the
supreme destination for those who are intelligent. A person who knows him is intelligent and obtains an understanding that is greater than all kinds of intelligence."'"'
