Bhishma said, "If one performs virtuous deeds, or gets others to perform virtuous deeds, one obtains assurance
because of those good deeds. However, the performer of wicked deeds does not obtain the assurance. In this
world, it is time which afflicts creatures and also shows them its favours. It overwhelms the intelligence of creatures and drives them along dharma and artha. When a person's intelligence shows him dharma and artha, he possesses dharma in his soul and obtains the assurance. His firmness of intelligence grants him that assurance. This
alone is the sign of wisdom in creatures. A person who knows about both[What should be done and what should not be done.] should look towards time and act accordingly. The men who possess this wealth are worshipped by other men. Those who know about dharma also honour these traits in their own selves. They never spend their time in polluting their practice of dharma with adharma. Therefore, they purify their souls so that they are reborn as those who practise dharma. They are like blazing
fires and adharma is always incapable of touching them. Dharma is protected by time. Time acts so that dharma is
victorious. In the three worlds, it is this that provides illumination. A man cannot seize an ignorant person  and
force him to act in accordance with dharma. Even if he practises dharma out of fear, he will resort to many kinds of
deceit."'
