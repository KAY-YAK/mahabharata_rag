'Bhishma said, "Those who are learned about the ancient accounts chant a
verse that was sung by Brahma himself. This is a path through which a king
can generate his treasury. 'The wealth of those who perform sacrifices, have
good conduct and are noble should not be taken, as it belongs to the gods[The text does not indicate where the Brahma quote starts, but this seems
to be the obvious place.].
A kshatriya should take from bandits and from those who do not perform
rites.' O descendant of the Bharata lineage! These subjects are for kshatriyas, who must protect them and also receive from them. The wealth belongs to kshatriyas and not to anyone else. The wealth must be used for the
sake of the army, or for the purpose of performing sacrifices. Herbs that are
inedible are severed and used to cook stuff that is edible[The inedible herbs are used as fuel. The inedible herbs are being compared to bandits and those who do not observe rites. Wealth is taken from
them and used for sacrifices and the treasury, the edible imagery.]. People who are
learned in the Vedas say that wealth that is not used as offerings for the
gods, the ancestors and mortals comes to no useful end. O king! A lord of
the earth who follows dharma should take these riches away. O king! When
it is like that[In the hands of bandits and those who do not observe rites.], it does not please the worlds and is not treasure. It must be
taken away from the wicked and given to the virtuous. If someone makes
himself into a bridge between the two, I think that person knows dharma.
Some people say that here and there, herbs and animals may originate from
injurious sources, but can nevertheless be used for sacrifices. Those who do
not perform the rites of sacrifices are like flies that bite and like aggressive
ants. That is what dharma pronounces. Dust and ulapa grass[A kind of soft grass.] can rise from
the ground. Dharma is like that, subtle and subtler."'
