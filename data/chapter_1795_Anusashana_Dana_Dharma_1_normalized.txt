Yudhishthira asked, "What is best for a man-non-violence, the rites of the Vedas, meditation, controlling the
senses, austerities or service to the preceptor?"

'Brihaspati replied, "All of these are different gates to dharma. O bull among the Bharata lineage! I will talk
about all six. Listen. I will tell you about what is supreme and best for creatures. If a man resorts to the dharma of
non-violence, this man always restrains the three sins that characterize all creatures, desire, anger, and obtains success[The third is left implicit. By inference, it is greed.]. If a person desires happiness for himself, he should be non-violent towards beings and should not use the
rod of chastisement against them. After death, he will then be happy. If a man looks upon all creatures as his own
self, controls the rod and conquers his anger, he obtains happiness after death. He sees himself in all beings and all
beings in his own self. Even the gods are confused in trying to follow his footsteps[Because he transcends the gods.]. One should never do something to others that one would regard as an injury to one's own self. In brief, this is dharma. Anything else is succumbing to desire. In refusing gifts, judging happiness and misery, the agreeable and the disagreeable, a man who
desires success must use the yardstick of how it would affect him[This is an oblique way of saying that one should place oneself in the other person's shoes.]. If one injures another person, one is in turn
injured by that other person. In that way, if one loves another person, one is in turn loved by that other person. For
the world of the living, this is the yardstick of dharma that has been instructed by the accomplished."'

Vaishampayana continued, 'The preceptor of the gods said this to Dharmaraja Yudhishthira. While they looked
on, the intelligent one then went to heaven.'
