Bhishma said, "Having arrived at the great Shvetadvipa, the illustrious rishi, Narada, saw those men, who were
fair in complexion and were like the rays of the moon. He was honoured by them and he worshipped them in
his mind, bowing his head down. Desiring to see the supreme one, he remained there, suffering all the hardships.
The brahmana and great sage was single-minded and remained there, with his arms upraised. He chanted this sto-
tra[Hymn.] to the great-souled one, who is without qualities and is the universe."
