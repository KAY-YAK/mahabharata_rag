Sanjaya said, "Krishna was advancing quickly and again spoke softly to
Partha. 'O Kouravya! Behold. The kings are advancing towards
Pandava[Yudhishthira.]. Behold Karna in this great arena, blazing like a fire. This Bhi-
ma is a great archer and has returned to fight again. With Dhrishtadyumna
at the forefront, the others have also returned and are following him-with
the Panchalas, the Srinjayas and the Pandavas leading the way. The large
army of the enemy is being shattered by the returning Parthas. O Arjuna!
The Kouravas who were running away have been held together by Karna.
His force is like that of Yama and his valour is Shakra's equal. O Kouravya!
Drona's son, supreme among the wielders of weapons, is advancing there.
In the battle, maharatha Dhrishtadyumna is advancing against him.' In this
way, the invincible Vasudeva described it to Kiriti. O king! Then, an extremely great and extremely fierce battle commenced. As the clash started,
roars like lions' were heard. O king! Both sets of soldiers preferred death to
retreat." '
