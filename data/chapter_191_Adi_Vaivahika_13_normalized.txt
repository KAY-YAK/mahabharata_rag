Vaishampayana said, 'After his alliance with the Pandavas, Drupada's fears were dispelled. He did not even fear
the gods. All the ladies in the great-souled Drupada's household came to Kunti. They mentioned their names and
saluted her, with their foreheads touching her feet. Dressed in a silken garment and with the marriage thread still
encircling her[Around her wrists.], Krishna also paid her respects to her mother-in-law and stood before her, her palms joined.

'Lovingly, Pritha bestowed her blessings on Droupadi, endowed with beauty and auspicious marks and with a
pure disposition and good character. "As Indrani[Indra's wife.] is to Harihaya[Indra.], as Svaha[The fire-god's wife.] is to Vibhavasu[The fire-god.], as Rohini[The moon-god's wife.] is
to Soma[The moon-god.], as Damayanti is to Nala, as Bhadra[Kubera's wife.] is to Vaishravana[Kubera, the god of wealth.], as Arundhati is to Vashishtha and as Lakshmi is to Narayana, so may you be to your husbands. O fortunate one! May you be the mother of long-lived and valorous sons. May you be happy. May you be fortunate and prosperous. May you be strict in your vows and a wife to
your husbands at the time of sacrifices. May you always pass your time serving your guests in the proper way-
holy men, the aged, the young and your seniors. May you be anointed queen, with the righteous king[Yudhishthira.], in the
kingdom and the capital of Kurujangala. Let the entire earth be conquered by your immensely powerful husbands
and presented to Brahmanas in a great horse-sacrifice. O accomplished one! O treasure of all virtues! May all the
riches of the world belong to you. May you be happy for 100 autumns. O daughter-in-law! I bless you today on
seeing you in silken garments. I shall bless you again when you have given birth to a son with all the qualities."

'After the Pandavas had taken a wife, Hari[Krishna.] sent them many golden ornaments, adorned with pearls and lapis
lazuli. Madhava[Krishna.] also sent them expensive garments from many regions, blankets, deer skins, jewels that were
beautiful and soft, and expensive beds, seats, vehicles and vessels, adorned with diamonds and lapis lazuli. Krishna
also gave them thousands of young maidservants, adorned with ornaments, beautiful, accomplished and brought
from many regions, well trained, and tame elephants, many excellent and caparisoned horses and many chariots,
drawn by horses with large teeth and excellent colours, bedecked with golden cloth. And Madhusudana[Krishna.], whose
soul cannot be measured, also sent them in a separate heap crores of pure gold coins. In a desire to please
Govinda[Krishna.], Dharmaraja Yudhishthira, who was filled with pure joy, accepted all this.'
