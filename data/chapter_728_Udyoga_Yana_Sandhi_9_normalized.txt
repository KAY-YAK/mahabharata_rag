Vaishampayana said, 'When Dhritarashtra's son, Duryodhana, refused to accept those words, all those lords among
men stood up and were silent. O great king! After all the kings of the earth had arisen, the king questioned Sanjaya
in private. He was under the control of his sons and wished for their victory. He tried to arrive at a conclusion
about himself, the others and the Pandavas. Dhritarashtra said, "O son of Gavalgana! Tell me about the strength
and the weakness of our own army. You know everything about the Pandavas. How are they superior? In which
way are they inferior? You know everything about the strengths of both sides. You are skilled about the decisions
that bring dharma and artha. O Sanjaya! I am asking you. Tell me everything. Which of the two sides will cease to
exist in the battle?" Sanjaya replied, "I will tell you, as long as it is not in secret. O king! Otherwise, you will hold
that against me. O Ajamidha! Bring your father[Krishna Dvaipayana Vedavyasa.], who is great in his vows, and Queen Gandhari. O Indra among
men! They are knowledgeable about dharma and skilled in their determination. They will dispel any hatred you
might feel. It is only in their presence that I will tell you everything about Vasudeva and Arjuna's thoughts." Having got to know[Through his mental powers.] about the intentions of Sanjaya and his son, the immensely wise Krishna Dvaipayana arrived
there and said, "O Sanjaya! Tell Dhritarashtra what he has asked. Answer his question completely. In this connection, tell him everything exactly as you know it, about Vasudeva and Arjuna."'
