Yudhishthira said, "In this world, men are extremely attracted to women. O king! They are overcome by great
confusion and think that this is because of destiny. In this world, it can be distinctly seen that women are also
attracted to men. O descendant of the Kuru lineage! Therefore, a great doubt is circling around in my heart. Why
are men attracted to women? Which are the men who attract and repel women? O tiger among men! How is one
capable of protecting them? You should tell me about women and men. They seem to be full of illusion and deceive men. If a man falls into their hands, how can he escape? Like a cow searching out new grass, they seem to
seize upon newer and newer men. The learned say that Shambara's maya, Namuchi's maya and that of Bali and
Kumbhinasa, all of that exists in a woman. When a man laughs, they laugh[The subject is suppressed in the text. We have expanded it, so that the meaning becomes clear.]. When a man cries, they weep. By
chance, even if a disagreeable person arrives at the house, they greet him with pleasant words. The intelligence of
a woman is superior to the sacred texts that Ushanas and Brihaspati know. That being the case, how can men protect themselves? They present falsehood as truth and truth as falsehood. O brave one! That being the case, how can
men protect themselves? O slayer of enemies! The purport of the sacred texts seems to have been derived from the
essence of feminine intelligence. I think that Brihaspati and others derived their norms of good conduct on that basis. When they are worshipped by men, they turn their minds away from men. O king! Women also agitate the
minds of men. How can one protect oneself? I have a great doubt on this score. O mighty-armed one! O extender
of the Kuru lineage! Tell me about this. O best among the Kuru lineage! If it is possible, how does one protect oneself against them? How does one do this? Has anyone managed to do this earlier? You should explain this to me."'
