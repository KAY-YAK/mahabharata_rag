'Yudhishthira asked, "You have spoken about the supreme ends that japakas
obtain. Is this the only end, or is there any other possibility?"

'Bhishma replied, "O king! O lord! Listen attentively to the end attained
by japakas. O bull among men! They may also descend into many kinds of
hell[In this context, hell is being used in a slightly different sense, as anything that falls short of complete liberation.]. If there is a japaka who does not initially follow what has already
been stated, or if he cannot complete those rites, he goes to hell. If there is a
japaka who shows disrespect, is not satisfied and grieves, there is no doubt
that such a person goes to hell. All those who suffer from ego go to hell. A
man who insults others will also go to hell. Those who are confused and
perform japa with the objective of obtaining fruits, are also those who desire hell. Those japakas who conduct themselves in the pursuit of riches[These riches can also be interpreted as the special powers obtained
through yoga.]
are also destined for hell and there is no emancipation for them. Those who
are confused and perform japa because of attachments descend into a state
where they obtain those attachments[That is, they are not freed.]. If a person is evil-minded and his
mind is not stable in wisdom, then his end is also unstable and he goes to
hell. There may be a japaka who is foolish and is not accomplished in his
wisdom. In his delusion, he goes to hell and having gone there, he has to
sorrow. If there is a japaka who performs japa with a firm mind, but fails to
complete it, he too goes to hell."

'Yudhishthira asked, "If a japaka has no specific objective and bases himself on the supreme and unmanifest brahman, why does he have to take
birth in a body?"

'Bhishma replied, "It is because of the lack of wisdom that one has to go
to many different kinds of hell. Japakas are praised. But they have taints in
their atmans."'
