'Yudhishthira asked, "What kind of a hell does a japaka go to? Describe it to me. A
great curiosity has arisen in me. You should tell me."

'Bhishma replied, "You have been born from Dharma[Yudhishthira was born from Dharma.]. You are naturally devoted
to dharma. O unblemished one! Listen attentively to these words, which have dharma as
their foundation. There are regions for the gods with supreme souls. These regions are
of many colours, many forms and many fruits. They are divine and have celestial vehicles and assembly halls that can go anywhere at will. O king! There are many kinds of
arenas, with lotuses and sparkling water. The residents of heaven, the four guardians of
the world, Shukra, Brihaspati, the Maruts, the Vishvadevas, the Sadhyas, the Ashvins,
the Rudras, the Adityas, the Vasus and others are there. O son! But in comparison with
the region of the paramatman, these are also hells. This spot has no fear or no objective
and is not enveloped in any kind of hardship whatsoever. It is free from both[The agreeable and the disagreeable.]. It is
free from the three[Sattva, rajas and tamas.]. It is free from the eight[The five elements, the senses, mind and intelligence.]. It is free from the three[Distinctions between the knower, the object of knowing and the act of
knowing.]. It is free of
the four characteristics and devoid of the four reasons[Seeing, thinking, hearing, knowing and the reasons behind these.]. It has neither unhappiness nor
happiness, nor sorrow or exhaustion. Time is cooked there[Time is subservient to the required needs.] and time is not the lord
there. O king! That region is the lord of time and is also the lord of heaven. The atman
alone is obtained there. Having gone there, one does not grieve. This is the supreme region. Hell is not like this. I have accurately detailed all the hells to you. That is the
supreme region. Everything else has characteristics of hell."'
