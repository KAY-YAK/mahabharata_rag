Vaishampayana said, 'When the rakshasa had been killed, the lord Kounteya, the king[Yudhishthira.], returned to Narayana's
hermitage and began to live there again. One day, he assembled all his brothers, together with Droupadi, and remembering his brother Jaya[Jaya and Vijaya are Arjuna's names. Bibhatsu is also one of Arjuna's names, as is Gandivadhanva, the one
with the Gandiva as his bow.], told them, "Pure in our ways, we have lived in the forest and four years have passed.
Bibhatsu promised that in the fifth year, he would come to the king of the mountains, the supreme peak that is
white at the top. In a desire to meet him, we should also go to that region. The immensely energetic Partha[Referring to Arjuna.] had
decided on the time and had earlier made an agreement with me. 'I will live as a student for five years.' We will
see Gandivadhanva, the destroyer of enemies, there, after he has returned from the world of the gods with the
weapons he has obtained." Having uttered these words, the Pandava consulted all the brahmanas and informed all
the ascetics about the reasons. Having thus pleased the ones who were terrible in their austerities, Partha[Referring to Yudhishthira.] circumambulated them. The brahmanas approved, because this was auspicious and would bring about welfare. "O bull
among the Bharata lineage! These difficulties will soon be replaced by happiness. O one learned in dharma! After
having traversed the road, you will protect the earth in accordance with the dharma of kshatriyas[The brahmanas and ascetics spoke these words.]." Then the king
accepted the words of these ascetics.

'The destroyer of enemies departed with his brothers and the brahmanas. The fortunate one was accompanied by
Droupadi and followed by Hidimba's son[Ghatotkacha.] and the other rakshasas and protected by Lomasha. He travelled part of
the way on foot. In other parts, the immensely energetic one, who was rigid in his vows, together with his brothers,
was carried by the rakshasas. Reflecting on the many difficulties, King Yudhishthira headed in a northern direction,
infested by lions, tigers and elephants. He saw the mountains Mainaka and Kailasa, the foothills of Gandhamadana
and the tall peak of Meru. There were many auspicious streams higher up on the mountains. He reached the sacred
plateau of the Himalayas on the seventeenth day. O king! Near Gandhamadana, the Pandava saw the auspicious
crest of the Himalayas, covered with many trees and creepers and the extremely holy hermitage of Vrishaparva,
surrounded by many trees in blossom that grew along whirlpools of water. The destroyers of enemies, the Pandavas, approached rajarshi Vrishaparva, with dharma in his soul. When he welcomed them, their exhaustion vanished. The rajarshi welcomed those bulls of the Bharata lineage, as if they were his sons. Thus honoured, those destroyers of enemies remained there for seven nights. On the eighth day, after consulting the rishi Vrishaparva who
was famous in the worlds, they decided to start on their journey. One by one, they introduced the brahmanas to Vrishaparva. He honoured them, and they remained in his charge for the moment, like relatives. The Pandavas also
left their supreme garments and pure ornaments in Vrishaparva's hermitage. He[Vrishaparva.] was learned, skilled, knowledgeable on everything concerning dharma and knew the past and the future. The one who was learned in dharma instructed the bulls of the Bharata lineage, like his sons. Having obtained his permission, the brave and great-souled
ones left in a northern direction, accompanied by Krishna and the great-souled brahmanas. King Vrishaparva went
with them for a short distance. Then entrusting the Pandavas to the immensely energetic brahmanas, and instructing and blessing the sons of Kunti, Vrishaparva returned, after having given them directions about the road to
follow.

'Truth was valour for Kounteya Yudhishthira. He proceeded on foot with his brothers, through a region that was
infested with many kinds of animals. They sometimes dwelt on the slopes of mountains, covered with many different kinds of trees. On the fourth day, the Pandavas reached Mount Shveta. It looked like a gigantic cloud and was
beautiful, with plenty of water. The beautiful top was covered with jewels and gold and had many peaks. They followed the route that had been indicated by Vrishaparva and saw many mountains in that region. They climbed
higher up the mountain, with extremely inaccessible caverns and many impenetrable spots, without any discomfort. Dhoumya, Krishna and the great rishi Lomasha travelled together, and none of them faltered. Those immensely valiant ones reached the great Mount Malyavan. It was full of the noise of many animals and birds and was populated by many kinds of birds. It was extremely beautiful and was frequented by masses of monkeys. There were
sacred ponds full of lotuses. There were pools and extensive groves. With their body hair standing up, they happily
saw Mount Gandhamadana, the habitation of kimpurushas, frequented by vidyadharas and lady kinnaras, infested
with elephants and lions and innumerable sharabhas[Sharabha has many meanings-young elephant, camel. It is also a mythical animal with eight legs, believed to
be stronger than a lion. In this context, one probably means the mythical animal.]. They reached a region that resounded with the sweet sounds
of many animals. With all this, Gandhamadana resembled the pleasure garden of Nandana[The name of Indra's pleasure garden.]. In a happy frame of
mind, Pandu's brave sons slowly entered this beautiful and sacred forest that brought delight to the mind and the
heart. With Droupadi and the great-souled brahmanas, the brave ones heard the delightful, pleasant, melodious and
charming sounds emerging from the mouths of birds.

'They saw many trees that were bent down because of the burden of their fruit. All of them were full of every
kind of fruit and were radiant with every kind of flower-mangoes, blossoming hog-plums[Amrataka.], coconuts,
tindukas[Kind of tree.], ajatakas[Kind of tree.], jiras[Kind of tree.], pomegranates, citrus trees[Bijapurakas.], jackfruit, breadfruit[Likuchas.], plantains[Mochas.], dates,
tamarinds[The critical edition's text says amravetasa, which doesn't sound right. It should probably be amlavetasa, that
is, tamarind.], paravatas[Kind of tree.], kshoudras[Kshoudra is another name for the champaka tree.], beautiful nipas[Nipa is another name for the kadamba tree.], bilvas[Tree sacred to Shiva.], wood-apples[Kapitthas.], roseapples[Jambus.], kashmaris[More a plant than a tree.],
badaris, figs[Plakshas.], udumbaras[Kind of tree.], fig trees[Vatas.], holy fig trees[Ashvatthas.], kshirinas[Tree difficult to identify, but must have been milky-white in colour.], marking-nuts[Bhallatakas.], myrobalans[Amalakas.],
haritakas[Type of myrobalan.], bibhitakas[Type of myrobalan.], ingudas[Medicinal tree.], karaviras[Kind of tree.], tindukas[Name of a tree.] with a lot of fruit and many other trees that were
on the slopes of Gandhamadana. There was succulent fruit as tasty as amrita. There were many champakas[Tree with yellow and fragrant flowers.],
ashokas[Tree with red flowers.], ketakas[Flowering plant. Ketakas are mentioned twice.], bakulas[Tree with fragrant flowers. Bakulas are mentioned twice.], pumnagas[Flowering tree also known as nagakeshara.], saptaparnis[Name of a tree.], karnikaras[Tree whose flowers have no smell.], ketakas, patalas[Red trumpet flower.], kutajas[Name of a tree.], beautiful coral trees[Mandaras.], blue lotuses[Indivaras.],, parijatas[Celestial tree, though the coral tree is also called parijata.], kovidaras[Name of a tree.], pine-trees[Devadarus. Literally, the tree of the gods.], shalas[Tall tree.], palms[Talas.], tamalas[Tree with dark bark.],
priyalas[Tree, also known as piyala.], bakulas, silk cotton[Shalmalis.], kimshukas[Tree with red blossoms.], ashokas[Tree with red blossoms. They are mentioned twice.], shimshapas[Name of a tree.] and saralas[The critical edition says taralas. But there is no obvious tree called tarala. This should probably be sarala,
which is a tall and straight species of pine.]. These were full of
chakoras[Bird, like a partridge.], woodpeckers[Shatapatras.], large bees[Bhringarajas.], parrots[Shukas.], cuckoos, sparrows[Kalavinkas.], haritas[Kind of pigeon.], birds[Jivas, birds in general.], pheasants[Jivakas.],
priyavratas[Clearly a bird, but with no obvious identification.], chatakas[Kind of bird believed to feed on raindrops.] and many other kinds of birds. They warbled beautiful notes that were pleasant to the
ear. They also saw beautiful ponds full of clear water, with white water lilies[Kumudas.], white lotuses[Pundarikas.], red lotuses[Kokanadas.],
blue lotuses[Utpalas.], white lotuses[Kahlaras.] and lotuses[Kamalas.] on all sides. There were geese[Kadamba. Geese are kaadamba, though in our system we have been writing it as kadamba. The critical
edition says kadamba, not kaadamba. If kadamba is the right reading, we are talking about a kind of tree. But given
the context, geese is more appropriate, so there is a typo in the text of the critical edition.], ruddy geese[Chakravakas.], ospreys, waterfowl,
ducks[Karandavas.], plavas[A diving aquatic bird.], swans, cranes, cormorants and many other aquatic birds everywhere. There were beautiful
ponds full of lotuses. Excited bumblebees hummed there, intoxicated by the nectar of red lotuses that bloomed during the day. Red pollen fell into the lotus cups. They saw these beautiful sights on the slopes of Gandhamadana.
And in the beautiful clusters of lotuses and groves of creepers that were everywhere, they saw peacocks with their
peahens. They were extremely maddened by the desire that the drumming of the clouds brought. In sweet and
melodious tones, they uttered their calls. The peacocks spread out the coloured plumage of their tails and danced
redolently, as did other playful forest birds. Others roamed happily with their beloved ones in the valleys that were
covered with creepers and lantanas. Where the woods were clear, they saw other birds in the holes of trees, beautiful and with splendid tails spread out like crowns[The trees seemed to be wearing crowns.].

'They saw graceful sindhuvara trees on the peaks of the mountain. They looked like Manmatha's[Manmatha is the god of love.] javelins,
covered with golden blossoms. There were beautiful karnikaras, blossoming like handsome earrings. They saw
kurubakas[A kind of amaranth tree.] flowering in the forest, like a volley of Kama's[Kama is the god of love.] arrows, increasing desire among those who are in
love. They saw tilakas[A kind of tree with beautiful flowers. Tilaka is also a mark made on the forehead.], like beautiful tilaka marks on the forest. They saw beautiful mango trees that were like
Ananga's[Ananga is the god of love. Literally, the word ananga means one without a body and there is a story about
how the god of love lost his body because of Shiva's rage.] arrows, abuzz with bees and clusters of flowers. There were many other trees on the peak of the mountain, like garlands-like gold, with flowers like a forest conflagration, red, black like collyrium and like lapis
lazuli. There were shalas, tamalas, patalas and bakulas. Thus, one by one, the brave ones saw these everywhere on
the slopes of Gandhamadana-frequented by masses of elephants and lions and tigers, resounding with the roars of
sharabhas and many other cries, and covered everywhere with fruit and flowers. The forests were yellow-tinged
like the sun. There were no thorns anywhere, or trees without blossoms. The trees on the slope of Gandhamadhana
were tender, and dense with foliage and fruit. On the peaks of the mountain, the Parthas also saw lakes and rivers
that were like clear crystal, populated by birds with white feathers, with the sounds of swans and cranes, with
colourful lotuses and blue lotuses, with fragrant garlands and succulent fruit. The trees on the peak of the mountain
were radiant with blossoms. There were many other groves full of trees there. There were many kinds of creepers,
laden with leaves, flowers and fruit.

'On seeing those trees on that supreme of mountains, Yudhishthira told Bhimasena in affectionate words, "O
Bhima! Look at this beautiful region all around us, the playground of the gods. We followed a path no human has
followed. O Vrikodara! We have achieved success. O Partha! Creepers, lantanas and blossoms embrace the
supreme of trees and adorn Gandhamadana's peak. O Bhima! Listen to the sound of the calls of peacocks, together
with peahens, on the peak of this mountain. Chakoras, shatapatras, intoxicated cuckoos and sarikas[Kind of bird.] are perching
themselves on these gigantic trees, full of foliage and flowers. O Partha! The birds are scarlet, yellow and red, on
the tops of the trees. Many other jivas and jivakas are glancing at each other. Cranes can be seen on the green and
red spots of grass that are everywhere and near the mountain springs. They are warbling in a beautiful voice,
charming to all beings. There are bees, ruddy geese and birds with backs tinged in red. There are elephants with
four tusks, with the hue of lotuses, and with the she-elephants. This great lake is beautiful, tinged with the hue of
lapis lazuli. Water streams down from many waterfalls. O Bhima! They shine like the sun and are like autumn
clouds. They adorn this giant mountain, with much silver and many minerals. In some places, it is dark like collyrium. In others, it is golden. In some places, the minerals are greenish yellow. In others, they have the complexion of
ingudas. There are mountainous caverns that have the hue of evening clouds. Some are as red as rabbits. Other
minerals are golden red. They are white and black, like clouds with the rays of the rising sun. In their many different forms, they are bringing great radiance to the mountain. O Partha! As Vrishaparva had said, gandharvas can be
seen on the peak of the mountain, together with their wives, and kimpurushas. O Bhima! The sounds of songs,
melodies and hymns can be heard in many ways, charming to all beings. Behold the great, pure and auspicious
Ganga, the river of the gods. It is full of masses of swans and is frequented by rishis and kinnaras. O Kounteya! O
destroyer of enemies! Behold this king of mountains, full of minerals, streams, kinnaras, animals, birds, gandharvas, apsaras, lovely woods, many types of predators and with a hundred different peaks." Those brave ones, the
scorchers of enemies, were delighted in their minds at having traversed that supreme path and their hearts were not
satisfied at looking at this king of the mountains. They then saw the hermitage of rajarshi Arshtishena[Though never made clear, Arshtishena might be Devapi, Shantanu's elder brother, who had resorted to the
forest.], full of
garlands and trees laden with fruit. They went to the sage Arshtishena, who was learned in dharma and was so severe in his austerities that he was lean and seemed to be made up of veins alone.'
