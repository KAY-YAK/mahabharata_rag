Duryodhana said, 'Thus did the illustrious god, the grandfather of all the
worlds, become the charioteer, when Rudra was the ratha. It is a duty for the
charioteer of a chariot to be braver than the ratha. O tiger among men!
Therefore, you should control the horses in the battle.'"

'Sanjaya said, "At this, Shalya, the lord of Madra, was delighted and embraced your son. He spoke these words to Duryodhana, the slayer of enemies. 'O king! O son of Gandhari! O handsome one! If this is what you
think, I will do everything that brings pleasure to you. O best of the
Bharatas! I will perform whatever task I am thought to be fit for. With my
entire heart, I will bear the burden of any task. For the sake of what is beneficial, I may speak words to Karna, pleasant and unpleasant. You and Karna
should pardon all of them.' Karna replied, 'O king of Madra! Like Brahma
for Ishana and like Keshava for Partha, may you always serve us for our
benefit.' Shalya said, 'There are four kinds of conduct not followed by
those who are aryas-self-censure, self-glorification, speaking ill of others
and adulation of others. O learned one! I will speak words for your own
good. They may be full of self-praise. But listen to them attentively. O lord!
In knowledge, skills of medication, controlling and avoiding
distractions[All of this is with reference to horses.], I am like Matali, fit to be Shakra's charioteer. O unblemished one! O son of a suta! When you are engaged in warring with Partha in
the battle, I will guide your horses. Do not be anxious on that account.'" '
