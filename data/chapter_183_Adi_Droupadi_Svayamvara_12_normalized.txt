Vaishampayana said, 'Hearing the words of their eldest brother, all of Pandu's sons, of infinite energy, were
pleased and began to think about the purport of those words. Suspecting them to be the foremost of the Kurus, the
chief of the Vrishnis[Krishna.] and Rohini's son[Balarama.] then came to the potter's house, where those foremost among men were
living. Krishna and Rohini's son saw Ajatashatru[One without enemies, Yudhishthira's epithet.], with long and thick arms, seated there. In a circle around him
sat the others, like blazing fires. Vasudeva went to Kunti's son, foremost among those who follow dharma. He
touched with his hands the feet of King Ajamidha[One of Yudhishthira's names.] Yudhishthira and said, "I am Krishna." Rohini's son went to
Yudhishthira and did the same. Seeing them, the descendants of Kuru were greatly delighted. O chief of the Bharata lineage! The chiefs of the Yadu lineage then touched the feet of their father's sister[Kunti.].

'Seeing Krishna, Ajatashatru, chief among the Kurus, asked him about his welfare and said, "O Vasudeva!
When we are living here in disguise, how did you manage to track us down?" Vasudeva smiled and replied, "O
king! Even when fire is covered, it comes out. Who but the Pandavas can display such valour among men? O destroyers of enemies! It was through good fortune that you escaped from that fire. It was through good fortune that
Dhritarashtra's evil son and his advisers did not succeed in their desires. Be blessed. Prosper, the way a fire hidden
in a cave gradually expands and spreads. Permit us to return to camp. Otherwise, the kings may discover you."

Then, taking permission from the Pandavas, the eternally radiant one quickly went away, accompanied by
Baladeva.'
