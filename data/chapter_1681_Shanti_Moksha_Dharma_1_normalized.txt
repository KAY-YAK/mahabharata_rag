Bhishma said, "O king! The brahmana honoured the foremost among serpents. He made up his mind to be initiated and desiring this, resorted to Chyavana, of the Bhargava lineage. O king! He[Chyavana.] performed the sacraments for him to be initiated into the way of dharma. O king! O Indra among kings! Bhargava also recounted this
story in Janaka's abode. He[Janaka.] described this sacred account to the great-souled Narada. O Indra among kings! O
foremost among the Bharata lineage! When he was asked, Narada, unblemished in his deeds, recounted this account in the abode of the gods. O lord of the earth! In ancient times, the king of the gods recounted this sacred account  to  an  assembly  of  the  praiseworthy  Vasus.  O  king!  When  I  fought  that  extremely  terrible  battle  with
Rama[Parashurama. The story of the battle between Bhishma and Parashurama has been recounted in Section 60 (Volume 5).], the Vasus recounted this story to me. O lord of the earth! O supreme among those who uphold dharma!
Having been asked by you, I have told you the truth about this sacred account, which is full of dharma. O descendant of the Bharata lineage! You asked me about supreme dharma. O king! This account is about a patient person
who acted in accordance with dharma and artha. That foremost among brahmanas was firm in his resolution and to
accomplish his objective, was instructed by the lord of the serpents. At the extremities of the forest, he practised
yama and niyama. He engaged in practices that were sanctioned by those who eat in accordance with unchha."' 
 
This concludes Moksha Dharma Parva and also concludes Shanti Parva.
