'Markandeya said, "When those soldiers were quartered, some groups of Ravana's followers, pishachas and rakshasas, attacked them-Parvana, Putana, Jambha, Khara, Krodhavasha, Hari, Praruja, Aruja, Praghhasa and others.
Remaining invisible, those evil-souled ones entered. But knowing this, Vibhishana removed their powers of invisibility. O king! On being seen, all of them were killed by the powerful monkeys, who could leap long distances, and
fell down on the ground. Unable to tolerate this, Ravana marched out with his army. He erected a battle formation
known as ushanas[A vyuha is a battle formation. This one is named after Ushanas or Shukracharya, the preceptor of the
demons.] and attacked the monkeys. On seeing Dashanana's army advance, Raghava also emerged
and attacked the stalker of the night with a battle formation recommended by Brihaspati[The preceptor of the gods.]. A battle then started
between Rama and Ravana. Lakshmana fought with Indrajit, Sugriva with Virupaksha, Nikharvata with Tara, Nala
with Tunda and Patusha with Panasa. On that field of battle, using the strength of one's arms, everyone fought with
another whom he considered to be a match. That terrible battle made one's body hair stand up, it was like the ancient one between the gods and the asuras. It kept on extending, increasing the fear of those who were cowards.
Ravana attacked Rama with a shower of spears, lances and swords. Raghava attacked Ravana with sharp iron arrows. In a similar way, Lakshmana pierced Indrajit's heart. Indrajit pierced Soumitri with many arrows. Without
hesitation, Vibhishana discharged at Prahasta, and Prahasta at Vibhishana, showers of sharp arrows that had the
plumes of birds on the shafts. There was an encounter between powerful and great weapons. It afflicted all the
three worlds and everything that was mobile and immobile."'
