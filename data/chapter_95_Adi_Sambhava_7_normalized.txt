Vaishampayana said, 'O king! After the marriage was over, King Shantanu instated the beautiful lady in his own
house. Then Satyavati bore Shantanu a wise and brave son named Chitrangada. He was superior to all men in valour. Then Satyavati again bore the powerful king another son. He was named Vichitravirya and he became a great
archer. O bull among the Bharata lineage! Before he could become an adult, the wise King Shantanu succumbed to
the law of destiny. Bhishma was always obedient to Satyavati. When Shantanu went to heaven, he instated Chitrangada, chastiser of enemies, on the throne. Through his valour, Chitrangada defeated all the kings. He could not
find anyone equal to himself among men.

'When he had defeated all gods, men and asuras, the powerful king of the gandharvas, who bore the same name
as him[The gandharva was also named Chitrangada.], came to him. On the fields of Kurukshetra, a great battle took place between these two powerful warriors, the king of the gandharvas and the king of the Kurus. On the banks of the river Hiranyavati, the battle went
on for three years. In that great duel, characterized by a shower of weapons, the gandharva used superior powers of
delusion[Maya.] to kill the supreme among the Kurus. Having killed Chitrangada, the best of the Kurus and one who
yielded wonderful bows and arrows, the gandharva went to heaven.

'O king! When that tiger among men, the one with a lot of energy, was killed, Shantanu's son Bhishma performed the funeral rites. Then the mighty-armed one instated Vichitravirya as the king of the Kuru kingdom,
though he was still a child and hadn't attained youth. Vichitravirya always listened to Bhishma's words and as a
king, ruled the kingdom of his father and grandfather. In accordance with dharma, the king paid homage to Shantanu's son Bhishma, who was skilled in dharma and the sacred texts. In return, Bhishma also protected him.'
