Vaishampayana said, 'King Yudhishthira, greatly generous, then had the funeral rites separately performed for all the kin who had been slain in the
battle[These are funeral rites being performed one month after death, they are
shraddha ceremonies.]. For the funeral rites of his sons, the immensely illustrious King
Dhritarashtra gave away all the objects of desire, full of qualities, cattle,
riches, many kinds of jewels and other extremely expensive objects. In a
similar way, with Droupadi, Yudhishthira donated for Karna, the great-
souled Drona, Dhrishtadyumna, Abhimanyu, the rakshasa who was Hidimba's son[Ghatotkacha.], Virata and the other well-wishers who had done good deeds for
him, Drupada and Droupadi's sons. He instructed that thousands of brahmanas should separately be given grain, garments, gems and cattle. There
were other kings who had no relatives and the king instructed that their funeral rites should also be performed. To perform the funeral rites of the
well-wishers, Pandava had many halls, reservoirs of water and lakes constructed. He repaid his debts and ensured that the worlds would not censure
him. Having done this, the king followed dharma and protected the subjects. He honoured Dhritarashtra, Gandhari, Vidura, all the Kourava advisers and servants, as he used to do earlier. There were some women whose
brave husbands and sons had been slain. Compassionately, the Kourava
king honoured and protected all of them. The lord, the king, was full of
compassion and non-violence and showed his favours to the distressed, the
blind and the miserable with houses, garments and food. Having conquered
the entire earth and having repaid his debts to his foes, the king was happy
and without any rivals. Yudhishthira enjoyed himself.'
