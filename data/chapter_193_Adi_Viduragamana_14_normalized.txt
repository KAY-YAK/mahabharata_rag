'Dhritarashtra said, "I myself have the worries that you do. But I do not wish to reveal my attitude to Vidura.
Therefore, I particularly praised their qualities, so that Vidura does not know my true wishes, even through a gesture. This is the time. O Suyodhana[Duryodhana.]! Tell me what you think. O Radheya[Son of Radha, that is, Karna.]! You also tell me what you think."

'Duryodhana said, "Let us now use skilled and able Brahmanas who have our trust to create conflict among the
Pandavas, between the sons of Kunti and the sons of Madri. Or let us tempt King Drupada, his sons and all his advisers with large presents of wealth so that they abandon Kunti's son, King Yudhishthira. Or let them[The Pandavas.] individually be told how difficult it is to live here[Hastinapura.], so that the Pandavas decide to live there[Panchala.], away from us. Or let artful
and skilled men create dissension among the sons of Pritha[Kunti.]. Or let them[Those employed by the Kouravas to sow seeds of dissension and jealousy in the minds of the Pandavas.] incite Krishna[Droupadi.] against them. That
should be easy, because they are many[Because Droupadi has many husbands.]. Let the Pandavas be dissatisfied with her, and she with them. O king! Let
artful and skilled men secretly bring about Bhimasena's death. He is the strongest among them. O king! When he
is dead, they will lose their enterprise and their energy. Without him, they will no longer wish for the kingdom, because he is their only support. Arjuna is invincible in battle as long as he is supported from the back by
Vrikodara[Bhima.]. Without him, Phalguna[Arjuna.] is not even worth a fourth of Radheya[Karna.] in battle. With Bhimasena dead,
they will know their great weakness and knowing our great strength, the feeble ones will perish. O king! If the
sons of Pritha come here and submit themselves to our desires, we can confidently destroy them. Or, one after another, we can seduce them with pretty women so that Krishna[Droupadi.] is disenchanted with Kunti's sons. Or we can send
Radheya to bring them here and on the way here, get them killed through an attack by dacoits whom we trust. Employ, without delay, whichever of these strategies seems to you to be faultless. Time passes. As long as their confidence in King Drupada, who is like a bull, is not established, until then, we can succeed. But not afterwards. O father! These are my views. We should suppress them. O Radheya! What do you think? Are these views good or
bad?"'
