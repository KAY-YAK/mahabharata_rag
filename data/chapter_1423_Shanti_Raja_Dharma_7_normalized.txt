'"Vamadeva said, 'The lord of the earth should prosper through victories
without battle. O lord of men! It is said that victory through a war is the
worst. If his foundations are not firm, he should not desire to obtain something. If the foundations are weak, a king's pursuit of gains is not recommended. If the countryside is prosperous and wealthy, if the king is loved, if
the advisers are satisfied and well nourished, then the king's foundations are
firm. When the warriors are well satisfied, content and well entrenched,
then the lord of the earth can conquer the earth with the slightest exertion of
force. If the residents of the city and the countryside are devoted to him, if
they are honoured well, if they possess riches and grain, then the king has a
firm foundation. When he thinks that at that time his own power is superior,
that is the time when an intelligent one desires the land and the riches of another. When he ignores objects of pleasure, when he is compassionate towards beings, when he protects his kingdom and his own self, he swiftly
prospers. When those on his side act well, but he behaves falsely towards
them, he then injures his own self, like a forest severed with an axe. If a
king is always engaged in killing, there is no end to those who hate him.
But if he knows how to control his anger, those who hate him cannot be
seen. The knowledgeable person does not engage in tasks that noble people
hate. He engages himself in tasks that are beneficial. Then, even if a king
indulges in acts of happiness though tasks are incomplete, his own self is
not tormented and others do not think ill of him. A lord of the earth who
acts in this way towards men conquers both the worlds and is established in
victory.'"

'Bhishma said, "Having been addressed in this way by Vamadeva, the
king followed everything in his deeds. If you act in this way, there is no
doubt that you will conquer both the worlds."'
