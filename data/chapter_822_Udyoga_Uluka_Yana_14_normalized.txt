'Sanjaya said, "Uluka then again spoke many words to Arjuna, as he had been asked to do. He angered him with
the stakes of his words, like a virulent serpent. On hearing his words, the Pandavas were extremely enraged. They
were already angry and the son of the gambler incited them even more. They arose from their seats and flailed their
arms around. They were wrathful like virulent serpents and glanced towards each other. With a drooping head,
Bhimasena glanced towards Keshava. His eyes were red at the corners. He sighed like a serpent. On seeing that the
son of the wind[Bhima.] was distressed and extremely enraged, Dasharha smiled and replied to the son of the gambler. 'O
son of a gambler! Leave swiftly and tell Suyodhana that his words have been heard. Their intent has been understood. It shall be the way he has said. But also tell Suyodhana these words from me. "O evil-minded one! Wait for
tomorrow. Be a man. O foolish one! You think that Janardana will not fight and Partha has chosen him as a charioteer. Therefore, you need not be frightened. But there will be a terrible time when I will burn down all the kings in
my rage, like a flame consumes straw. However, because of Yudhishthira's instructions, I will be the charioteer of
the great-souled Phalguna. He himself knows the way to fight. Even if you run away to the three worlds, even if
you enter the ground, you will see Arjuna's chariot in front of you tomorrow. If you think that Bhimasena's roar
amounts to nothing, you can be certain that Duhshasana's blood will be drunk. Partha, or King Yudhishthira, or
Bhimasena, or the twins, do not pay the slightest attention to your contrary ramblings."'"'
