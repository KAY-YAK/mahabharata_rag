'Dhritarashtra said, "O Sanjaya! I am asking you. Tell me again about Pundarikaksha. O son[The word used is tata.]! When I know the
meanings of his names and his deeds, I will be able to obtain Purushuttoma."

'Sanjaya replied, "I have heard Vasudeva's auspicious names recited. From that, as far as I can make out, Kesha-
va cannot be measured. Because he clothes all beings, because he is the womb of all the gods, he is known as Vasudeva[Vas means to put on or wear, vasu means riches. However, all of these names have alternative derivations.]. He is known as Vishnu because he is virile[Vrishan means a bull or a stallion.]. O descendant of the Bharata lineage! Know that he is
known as Madhava because of his silence, his meditation and his yoga[The etymological derivation is unclear. 'Ma' of Madhava seems to be derived from mouna (silence), while
'dha' is derived from dhyana (meditation).]. Because he has the essence of everything within himself, and because he killed Madhu, he is known as Madhusudana[Vishnu killed a demon named Madhu. Madhu also means honey or sweetness.]. The word krishi means the
earth, while na means bliss. Since Krishna means the combination of these two, he is the eternal Krishna. Pundarika means the supreme region that is eternal, without decay and is everlasting. Because his nature is like that, he is
known as Pundarikaksha. He is Janardana because he oppresses dasyus[Jana means people. Janaa is also the name of a demoness killed by Krishna (Vishnu).]. Because he never lacks in vigour[Sattva.],
because his vigour never diminishes, he is known as Satvata because of vigour. Because he is like a bull, he is
known as Vrishabhekshana[One with the eyes of a bull.]. Since he has not been born from a mother, the one who is the destroyer of armies is
known as Aja[One without birth.]. He is self-resplendent and because he controls[Dama.] the gods, he is known as Damodara. Because of
his delight and happiness and because he is the lord of happiness and prosperity, he is known as Hrishikesha[Isha is lord, while hrishika is happiness.].
Because he bears up heaven and earth in his arms, he is known as Mahabahu[The one with the large arms.]. Since he never falls
downwards[Adho.], he is known as Adokshaja. He is known as Narayana because he is the path followed by men[Nara means men and ayana means path.].
He is Purushottama because he fills up[Purana.] and destroys again. He is Sarva[Everything.] because he is the origin and the dissolution of everything that exists and does not exist, and because he is a witness to everything. Krishna is established
in truth and truth is established in him. Govinda is the truth that is beyond truth and that is the reason he has the
name of Satya[Truth.]. The god is known as Vishnu because of his valour. He is known as Jishnu[The victorious one.] because of his triumphs. He is Ananta[Without an end.] because he is eternal. He is Govinda because he knows about the cattle[Go means cattle.]. He can make
the unreal appear as real. Thus, he deludes all beings. Such is he, the illustrious one who is always with hermits.
He is always based in dharma. The mighty-armed Achyuta will arrive[As a messenger.] to prevent violence."'
