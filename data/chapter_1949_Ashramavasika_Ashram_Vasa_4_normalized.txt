Arjuna said, "O Bhima! You are my elder brother and my senior and I am not interested in saying anything
more. Rajarshi Dhritarashtra must always be honoured. Virtuous people, the best among men, remember the
good deeds that have been done to them. They do not remember crimes and the breaking of agreements. O Kshatta! Convey my words to the Kourava king. I will give him whatever he desires on account of his sons and for
Bhishma and all the others, all the well-wishers who helped our cause. O lord! It will be given from my store of
riches. Let Bhima not be greatly distressed at this."'

Vaishampayana said, 'When Arjuna spoke in this way, Yudhishthira honoured him. But Bhimasena cast angry
glances at Dhananjaya. The intelligent Yudhishthira spoke these words to Vidura. "The king should not be angry at
Bhimasena. In the forest, the intelligent Bhima was afflicted by cold, rain and heat and many kinds of hardships.
That is known to you. However, convey my words to the king who is a bull among the Bharata lineage. He can
take everything that he wishes from my house. Bhima sorrows greatly and has exhibited this intolerance. The king
should not take these words to heart. Whatever riches exist in my house and that of Arjuna's, the great king is the
owner of all of that. Tell the king these words. Let the king give to brahmanas and spend whatever he wishes. Let
him repay the debt to his sons and well-wishers. This body of mine also belongs to that lord of men. O Kshatta!
Knowing this, how can there be any doubt about the riches?"'
