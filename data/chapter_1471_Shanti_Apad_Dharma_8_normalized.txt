'Bhishma said, "On seeing that the pigeon had descended into the fire, Lub-
dhaka was overcome with compassion and again spoke these words. 'In my
stupidity, I have committed a violent deed like this. As long as I am alive,
this sin will always be lodged in my heart.' Condemning himself, he repeatedly kept speaking in this way. 'Shame on my great stupidity and the deceitful conduct I have always engaged in. Having abandoned auspicious
deeds, I have sought to capture birds. I have resorted to violence. There is
no doubt that, by offering me its own flesh, the great-souled pigeon has instructed me. I will abandon my sons and wife and give up my own beloved
life. The pigeon, extremely devoted to dharma, has instructed me about
dharma. I will offer up my own body and avoid all objects of pleasure. I
will shrivel it up, like a little bit of water during the summer. I will endure
the torment of hunger and thirst. I will become lean, as if I am made up of
veins. To ensure the worlds hereafter, I will observe many different kinds of
fasting. Alas! By giving up its own body, it has shown me how guests must
be treated. Therefore, I will follow dharma. Dharma is the supreme objective. O supreme among birds[This is being addressed to the she-pigeon.]! Dharma is seen to be that which has been
followed by that foremost practitioner of dharma.' Having spoken this,
Lubdhaka, the performer of evil deeds, became rigid in his vows and resolved to depart on mahaprasthana[Literally, the great journey. A person leaves on mahaprasthana when he
departs from home and wanders around, awaiting death.]. He discarded his staff, his pointed
stick[Used for catching birds.], his net and his cage. He also freed the imprisoned pigeons[The plural is used. There were other captured pigeons too.] and
departed."'
