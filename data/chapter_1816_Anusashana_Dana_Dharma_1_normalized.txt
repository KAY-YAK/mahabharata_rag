Vaishampayana said, 'Having heard everything about dharma and about everything that purifies, Yudhishthira
again spoke to Shantanu's son. "Who is the single divinity in the world? Who is the single one who is the
refuge? Who should a man praise and worship to obtain what is beneficial? In your view, what is the supreme
dharma among all kinds of dharma? What mantras should be chanted to free a creature from the bondage of this
cycle of life?"

'Bhishma replied, "The lord of the universe is the infinite god of the gods. He is Purushottama. A man must always arise and chant his one thousand names. A man must always devotedly worship the one without decay. One
must meditate on him and praise him. One must perform sacrifices for him. Vishnu is without beginning and without end. He is the great lord of all the worlds. He is the controller of the worlds and must always be praised. One
will then transcend all misery. He is devoted to brahmanas. He knows about all kinds of dharma. He is the one who
enhances deeds in the worlds. He is the protector of the worlds. He is the great being. All the creatures originated
in him. It is my view that this is the supreme dharma among all kinds of dharma. A man must always devotedly
praise Pundarikaksha. He is supreme in his great energy. He is supreme in his great austerities. He is the supreme
and great brahman. He is the supreme refuge. He is purest among all objects that are pure. He is the most auspicious among all objects that are auspicious. He is the god among all the gods. He is the undecaying father of all
creatures. When the beginning of a yuga commences, all creatures owe their origin to him. When there is destruction at the end of  a yuga, everything merges  into him. O  lord of  the earth! He  is Jagannatha, foremost in the
worlds. Listen to Vishnu's one thousand names. They dispel all sin and fear. The great-souled one possesses minor
names and famous ones. The rishis chanted them. For the sake of prosperity, I will state them. (1) Vishva[The omnipresent one. The text doesn't have the numbering. We have introduced it for convenience. Some of the

Since there is repetition, the actual number of names fall short
of 1000.]. These are recited
as the one thousand names of the great-souled Keshava. I have recounted them in detail and these divine names
must be chanted. A man who always listens to these and recites them does not confront anything inauspicious, in
this world and in the next. Such a brahmana obtains the Vedanta and a kshatriya becomes victorious. A vaishya becomes prosperous and a shudra obtains happiness. A person in search of dharma obtains dharma. A  person  in
search of artha obtains artha. A person who desires objects of desire obtains objects of desire. A person who wants
offspring obtains offspring. One must awake in the morning, purify one's mind and with devotion, recite Vasudeva's one thousand names. He will obtain great fame and become foremost among his relatives. He will obtain a
prosperity that is not destroyed and will obtain supreme benefit. He will never face any fear and will obtain valour
and energy. He will not suffer from disease. He will be radiant and will be full of strength, beauty and other qualities. A person afflicted by disease will be freed from disease. A person who is bound down will be freed from
bondage. A person who is scared will be freed from his fear and will be freed from all catastrophes. A man who
always chants Purushottama's one thousand names with devotion will be able to quickly overcome all hardships. A
mortal person must seek refuge with Vasudeva. He must be devoted to Vasudeva. He will then be freed from all
sins and, pure in soul, will obtain the eternal brahman. A person who is devoted to Vasudeva never faces anything
inauspicious. For such a person, there is no fear from birth, death, old age and disease. With faith and devotion,
one must study these words of praise. One will then unite oneself with happiness, forgiveness of character, prosperity, fortitude, memory and deeds. There will be no anger, jealousy, greed or inauspicious tendencies. A person
who is devoted to Purushottama accomplishes auspicious deeds. The firmament, the moon, the sun, the nakshatras,
the directions, the earth and the great ocean-all these are pervaded with the great-souled Vasudeva's valour. The
gods, the asuras, the gandharvas, the yakshas, the serpents, the rakshasas and everything mobile and immobile in
the universe-all these are under Krishna's subjugation. The senses, mind, intelligence, spirit, energy, strength and
fortitude-all of these are said to be part of Vasudeva's soul. He is the kshetra and the kshetrajna. In all the sacred
texts, conduct is said to be the foremost. Conduct is based on dharma and he is said to be the lord of dharma. The
rishis, the ancestors, the gods, the great elements, the minerals and everything mobile and immobile in the universe
has originated from Narayana. The knowledge of yoga, the knowledge of sankhya, all the acts of artisanship, the
Vedas, the sacred texts and vijnana-all these originated from Janardana. Vishnu is the single great being. He has
manifested himself in many kinds of forms. He pervades the three worlds and is in the soul of all creatures. He is
the undecaying enjoyer who enjoys the universe. This praise of the illustrious Vishnu was chanted by Vyasa. If a
man desires to obtain benefit and happiness, he should read it. He is the lord of the universe. He is without origin.
He is the undecaying god whose power pervades the universe. A person who worships Pundarikaksha does not
have to face defeat."'
