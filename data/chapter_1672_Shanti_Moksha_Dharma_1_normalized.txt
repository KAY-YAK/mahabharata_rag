The brahmana said, 'I have heard your words of reassurance. It is as if a load has been taken off the back of
someone who is bearing a great load. Your  words  have delighted me-like a tired person  when  he lies
down, like an exhausted person when he finds a seat, like a thirsty person when he finds a drink, like a hungry person when he finds food, like a guest who is given the desired food at the right time, like an aged person who obtains a beloved son after a long time and like the sight of a beloved one has been thinking about. I have been like a
hesitant person, casting his eye towards the sky. Your words of wisdom have served to instruct me. I will certainly
do what you have asked me to. O virtuous one! Spend this night with me. In the morning, happily go wherever you
wish to. The illustrious Surya is gradually withdrawing his rays.'"

'Bhishma continued, "O destroyer of enemies! At this, the guest accepted his hospitality. He spent the night with
the brahmana. They had a conversation that was full of words of dharma. They spent the night in this way and it
was almost as if it was day. When it was morning, the brahmana honoured the guest, according to his capacity, and
desired to accomplish his own objective. The brahmana made up his mind to accomplish dharma. The one who
knew about dharma took the permission of his relatives. As instructed, at the right time, resolving to perform good
deeds, he set out for the residence of the Indra among serpents."'
