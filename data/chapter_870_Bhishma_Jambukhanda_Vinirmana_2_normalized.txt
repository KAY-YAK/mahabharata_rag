'Dhritarashtra said, "Tell me about Bharatavarsha, where this senseless army has gathered, and for which, my son
Duryodhana is so avaricious. The sons of Pandu desire it and my mind is immersed in it. O Sanjaya! I am asking
you, because you are skilled."

'Sanjaya said, "O king! Listen to my words. The Pandavas are not covetous about this. It is Duryodhana who
covets it, and so does Shakuni Soubala. There are other kshatriyas, who are the kings of many countries, who are
greedy about Bharatavarsha and cannot tolerate each other. O descendant of the Bharata lineage! I will now describe to you the land that is named after Bharata[Though written as Bharata, the country is actually Bhaarata and is named after Bharata.]. O king! This is loved by the god Indra, Vaivasvata Manu[Each manvantara (era) is presided over by a sovereign known as Manu. It is because humans are descended
from Manu that they are known as manava. There are fourteen manvantaras and fourteen Manus to preside over
them. The present manvantara is the seventh and the Manu who presides over this is known as Vaivasvata, because he was born from the sun (Vivasvat).],
Prithu Vainya[Vainya means Vena's son. King Prithu was a virtuous king who was Vena's son. Prithivi or prithvi, the earth, is
named after Prithu.]>, the great-souled Ikshvaku[The founder of the solar dynasty.], Yayati[The son of Nahusha. Both the Pandavas and the Yadavas are descended from Yayati. Yayati's story has been
recounted in Section 7 (Volume 1).], Ambarisha[King of the solar dynasty, the son of Nabhaga.], Mandhata[King of the solar dynasty, the son of Yuvanashva. Mandhata's story has been recounted in Section 33 (Volume
Three ).], Nahusha[King of the lunar dynasty. Nahusha's story has been recounted in Section 49 (Volume 4).],
Muchukunda[Mandhata's son.], Shibi Oushinara[Oushinara means the son of Ushinara. Shibi was the son of King Ushinara of the lunar dynasty and was famous
for his generosity.], Rishabha[King mentioned in the Bhagavata Purana as the father of Bharata.], Aila[Aila means the son of Ila. Ila was the daughter of Vaivasvata Manu and gave birth to Pururava. Aila means
Pururava.], King Nriga[King Nriga inadvertently donated the same cow to two brahmanas. He was cursed and became a lizard that
lived in a well. Krishna rescued him from this curse.] and other powerful kshatriyas. O
great king! O Indra among kings! O descendant of the Bharata lineage! O scorcher of enemies! All of them loved
Bharata and I will describe this varsha as I have heard it.

should read phala, not bala. In that case, the rivers produce great merit.]. Other than these, there are hundreds and thousands of other rivers. O king! To the extent I
remember, I have described these rivers to you.

'"O lord! I have only given brief indications about these countries. If the earth and its qualities and strengths are
properly used, it becomes like a milch cow that yields objects of desires and leads to the great fruit of the three objectives[Dharma, artha and kama.]. The brave kings who know about dharma and artha are covetous of these. Because of greed for these
riches, they have readily agreed to give up their lives in battle. The earth is the refuge and is desired by those who
have the bodies of gods and men. O foremost among the Bharata lineage! The kings desire to enjoy the earth and
have become like dogs that are trying to snatch meat from each other. Their desires will never be satisfied. O king!
It is for this reason that the Kurus and the Pandavas have tried to obtain the possession of the earth through conciliation, gifts, dissension and chastisement[Sama, dana, bheda and danda respectively.]. O bull among men! If the earth is looked after well, she becomes the
father, the mother, the son and heaven for all beings."'
