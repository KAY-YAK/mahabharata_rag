The brahmana said, 'O timid one! You have censured me according to your intelligence. But I do not roam
around in the world in that way. I am a brahmana. I am free. I dwell in the forest. Despite resorting to the
dharma of being a householder, I am a brahmachari. O beautiful one! I am not what you see with your eyes. Everything in this universe that has come and gone is pervaded by me. Know me to be the one that destroys every object
in this world, mobile and immobile, like fire consumes wood. I know that my intelligence is superior to sovereignty over everything on earth and even that in heaven. That intelligence is my wealth[The intelligence of being one with the brahman.]. This is the single path that is
traversed by all brahmanas. Whether they are in households, reside in forests, dwell in the houses of their preceptors or are mendicants, irrespective of the many kinds of signs they displace, they use their intelligence to worship
only this. They may resort to many kinds of signs, but the intelligence is based on tranquility in the soul. The destination is a single one, like that of rivers heading to the ocean. That path is traversed through intelligence. It is not a
path that is traversed by the body. All action has a beginning and an end and the body is bound down by action. O
extremely beautiful one! Therefore, you should not entertain any fear about the life hereafter. Be devoted to me[As the brahman.]
and it is into me that your atman will merge.'"'
