Vaishampayana said, 'At that[At Yudhishthira's prayers.], Divakara was pleased and showed himself to the Pandava in his own body. He
was radiant and blazed like the fire. "O king! You will get everything that you wish for. I will provide you food for
the twelve years. There will be no shortage of the four kinds of food in your kitchen-fruit, roots, meat and vegetables. There will be no shortage of many riches too." Having said this, he vanished[The critical edition excises some shlokas here. In these missing shlokas, the sun-god presents Droupadi with
a copper vessel. Until Droupadi had eaten, the copper vessel would remain full and others could be fed. But once
she had eaten, the vessel would become empty.].

'Having obtained this boon, Kounteya, knowledgeable in the ways of dharma, arose from the water[Yudhisthira had immersed himself in the water to pray to Surya.]. The one
without decay grasped Dhoumya's feet and embraced his brothers. He went and met Droupadi. While she watched,
the lord Pandava cooked the food in the kitchen. However, once cooked, the four kinds of forest fare[Fruit, roots, meat and vegetables.] increased
and became inexhaustible. With that, he fed the brahmanas. When the brahmanas had been fed and his younger
brothers had also eaten, Yudhishthira later ate the remainder and this came to be known as vighasa[Vighasa means leftover food, or half-eaten morsels.]. After feeding Yudhishthira, Parshati[Prishata's (Drupada) daughter, Droupadi.] ate the remnants. The lord[Yudhishthira.], who was as radiant as Divakara himself, thus obtained a
boon from Divakara and gave the brahmanas all that they desired. On the appointed tithis and nakshatras, with his
priest at the forefront, he performed sacrifices in accordance with the mantras and the rituals. Thereupon, with their
departure blessed, the Pandavas, with Dhoumya and surrounded by a mass of brahmanas, left for the forest of
Kamyaka.'
