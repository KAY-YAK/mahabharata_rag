'Dhritarashtra said, "O Vidura! Is there anything that you have not spoken about so far? Tell me, since I am eager
to listen to you. You are speaking about wonderful things."

'Vidura replied, "O Dhritarashtra! O descendant of the Bharata lineage! The ancient and eternal youth Sanatsujata has said that there is no death. O great king! That supreme among intelligent ones will speak to you. He will
bring out everything that is overt and covert, clinging to the heart."

'Dhritarashtra asked, "Do you not know what that eternal one will tell me? O Vidura! You must tell me, if you
have that much of wisdom left."

'Vidura replied, "I have been born from a shudra womb. It is for that reason that I cannot tell you anything
more. But I know about the eternal intelligence of that youth. He was born in a brahmana womb and speaks about
matters that are extremely secret. I will be censured by the gods by speaking to you about those."

'Dhritarashtra asked, "O Vidura! Tell me. Here, and in this body of mine, how can I meet the ancient and eternal
one?"'

Vaishampayana said, 'Vidura thought about the rishi who was rigid in his vows. O descendant of the Bharata
lineage! And having got to know about those thoughts, he showed himself. Vidura received him in accordance
with the decreed rites and tasks. When he was rested and happily seated, Vidura told him, "O illustrious one! There
is a doubt in Dhritarashtra's mind, which I am incapable of explaining. You should speak to him. On hearing this,
this Indra among men will transcend all happiness and unhappiness, all gain and loss, and all pleasure and displeasure. Then old age and death will not overcome him, or fear and intolerance, hunger and thirst, insolence and power, hatred, lassitude, desire, anger, decline and rise."'
