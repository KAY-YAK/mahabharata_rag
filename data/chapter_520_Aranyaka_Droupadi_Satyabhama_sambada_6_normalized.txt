'Droupadi said, "I will tell you about a way that is without deceit, for capturing the heart of the husband. O friend!
If you follow that true path, you will be able to restrain your husband from other women. O Satya! In all the
worlds, with all their gods, there is no god equal to the husband. You will obtain all your desires through his
favours. But if he is angered, you will lose them. It is from there that you obtain offspring, various objects of desire, beds, seats, garments that are wonderful to see, garlands, fragrances, the world of heaven and extensive fame.
Happiness cannot be obtained through easy means. It is through hardship that a virtuous woman finds happiness.
Therefore, always worship Krishna with all your heart, love and affectionate deeds. Through beautiful seats, excellent garlands, various fragrances and prompt service, he will know that you love him and will himself embrace you
with all his affection. When you hear your husband's voice at the gate, you must arise and stand in the middle of
the house. When you see him enter, you must swiftly give him a seat. You must worship him with water for washing the feet. Send your servant girls away. Arise and do every task yourself. O Satya! Let Krishna know that you
love and worship him with all your soul. When your husband says something in your presence, protect it as a secret, even if it is not a secret. If one of your co-wives reports it to Vasudeva, he might feel disenchanted with you.
Through whatever means, you must invite for meals those whom your husband loves, those who are devoted to
him and those who desire his welfare. But you must always distance yourself from his enemies and opponents,
those who wish him ill and those who are evil and deceitful. If the man is intoxicated or distracted, control your
mind and maintain silence. You should never spend a long time alone with your sons, Pradyumna and Samba. You
should be friends with women who are born in noble lineages and those who are virtuous and without sin. You
must avoid those who are wrathful, addicted to drink, addicted to food, thieves, evil and fickle. This is the glorious
secret of love, which leads to heaven and ensures the destruction of enemies. Therefore, adorn yourself with expensive garlands, ornaments, unguents and pure fragrances and worship your husband."'
