Vaishampayana said, 'Bhishma became silent then, like a picture that has been painted. Vyasa, Satyavati's son,
thought for a short while. He then spoke these words to the King Gangeya, who was lying down. "O king!
With all his brothers and the kings who have followed him, Yudhishthira, the king of the Kurus, has been brought
back to a state of normalcy. The tiger among men is worshipping you, together with the intelligent Krishna. You
should now give him permission to return to the city." Thus addressed by the illustrious Vyasa, the king who was
the son of the river granted Yudhishthira, and his advisers, permission. The king who was Shantanu's son spoke
these sweet words. "O king! Enter the city and let your mental anxiety be dispelled. O Indra among kings! Placing
self-control and devotion at the forefront, like Yayati, perform many kinds of sacrifices and give away large quantities of dakshina. O Partha! Remain engaged in the dharma of kshatriyas and satisfy the ancestors and the gods.
With your mental anxiety dispelled, engage in what is beneficial. Delight all the subjects and let there be natural
tranquility. As is proper, honour all the well-wishers with the fruits. O son! For their subsistence, let all the friends
and well-wishers follow you, like the birds seek refuge in a tree that stands at a sacred spot and is laden with fruit.
O king! Return here again, when it is time for me, when the sun retreats and begins to move towards uttarayana."

Having been thus addressed, Kounteya worshipped the grandfather. With his family, he left for the city of Nagasahvya. Placing Dhritarashtra and Gandhari, who was devoted to her husband, at the forefront, and with the
rishis, all his brothers, Keshava, the inhabitants of the city and the countryside and the aged ministers, the king,
foremost among the Kurus, entered the city of Varanasahvya.'

This ends Dana Dharma Parva.
