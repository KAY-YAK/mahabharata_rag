Vaishampayana said, 'Having spoken these words, devarshi Narada
stopped. However, rajarshi Yudhisthira was overcome by sorrow and continued to think. The brave one was distressed in his mind and his head hung
down in sorrow. He sighed like a serpent and his eyes were full of tears.
Kunti's limbs were also overcome with sorrow and grief had robbed her of
her senses. However, she spoke these sweet and important words that were
suitable to the occasion. "O Yudhishthira! O mighty-armed one! You should
not grieve. O immensely wise one! Conquer your sorrow and listen to my
words. O supreme among those who uphold dharma! Earlier, I tried so that
he might let you know that he was your brother and so did the sun god, his
father. In front of me, the sun revealed himself in a dream to him and told
him words that a well-wisher who desired his benefit and prosperity would
say[This has also been described in Section 55 (Volume 4).]. But despite our entreaties and our affection, I or the sun god did not
succeed. We could not persuade him. Nor could we persuade him to unite
with you. He was under the subjugation of destiny and was engaged in fanning the enmity with you. He was engaged in causing you injury. So he was
ignored by me." When his mother said this, Dharmaraja's eyes filled with
tears. With his senses clouded by tears, the one with dharma in his soul
spoke these words. "I am extremely distressed because you kept this a secret." Tormented by extreme grief, the immensely energetic one cursed all
the women of the world, "Henceforth, they will not be able to keep a
secret." The king remembered his sons, grandsons, relatives and well-wishers and his heart became extremely anxious. He lost control over his senses.
Because he was overcome by sorrow, he was like a fire with smoke. Tormented and oppressed, the king yielded to despair.'
