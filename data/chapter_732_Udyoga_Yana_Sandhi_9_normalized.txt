'Dhritarashtra said, "O Sanjaya! I envy those who have eyes, because they can see Vasudeva before them. His
supreme and radiant form illuminates the direction and the sub-directions. He will speak words that deserve to be
honoured, because they will be for the good of the Bharatas and the Srinjayas. Those unblemished words should be
accepted by those who wish to live, though they need not be accepted by those who are doomed. He will come to
us, the solitary champion of the Satvatas. He is the bull who guides the Yadavas. He destroys enemies and causes
terror among them. He takes away fame from those who hate him. The assembled Kurus will see the great-souled
and venerable destroyer of enemies. That best of the Vrishni lineage will speak words of non-violence and thus
win over my side. He is the eternal and wise rishi. He is an ocean of words. He is a pot among all ascetics. He will
come with the golden-feathered Garuda Arishtanemi[Garuda was Kashyapa's son and so was Arishtanemi. Therefore, Arishtanemi was a brother to Garuda. But Arishtanemi is also used to refer to Kashyapa. Consequently, Arishtanemi here means Arishtanemi's son.]. He is the lord of all beings and the refuge of the universe.
He is the ancient being with one thousand heads. He has no beginning, no middle and no end. His deeds are infinite. He is the one who places the seed. Though without birth, he is the creator. He is supreme and higher than the
supreme. I seek refuge with him. He is the creator who made the three worlds, the gods, the asuras, the serpents
and the rakshasas. He is foremost among wise lords of men. He is Indra's younger brother. I seek refuge with
him."'
