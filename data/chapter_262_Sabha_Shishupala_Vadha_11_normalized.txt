Vaishampayana said, 'On seeing that ocean of kings angrily agitated like the sea, Yudhisthira spoke to the old
Bhishma, best among those who are intelligent and the grandfather of the Kurus. It was like the greatly energetic
Puruhuta[Indra's name.] speaking to Brihaspati. "This great ocean of kings is agitated with anger. O grandfather! Tell me what I
should do now. O grandfather! Tell me now, in detail and completely, what I must do to prevent an obstruction to
the sacrifice, so that the welfare of the subjects is ensured." When Dharmaraja Yudhishthira, knowledgeable in
dharma, uttered these words, Bhishma, the grandfather of the Kurus, thus spoke to him, "O tiger among the Kuru
lineage! Do not be frightened. Can a dog kill a lion? I have already chosen a path that is auspicious and in conformity with good policy. All these rulers of the earth bark like a pack of dogs around a sleeping lion. O son! Like
dogs angrily barking before a lion, they stand before the sleeping lion of the Vrishni lineage. As long as the lion
Achyuta is asleep, this bull among Chedis and like a lion himself, makes those others seem like lions. O best of
kings! O son! Shishupala has limited sense. Through he who is the soul of everything[Krishna.], he desires to take all these
kings to Yama's abode. O descendant of the Bharata lineage! It is certain that Adhokshaja[Vishnu and Krishna's name.] will take away Shishupala's energy. O Kounteya! O supreme among intelligent ones! You will be fortunate. The intelligence of the king
of Chedi, and that of all these kings, has gone astray. Whomever that tiger among men[Krishna.] wishes to take, his intelligence goes as astray as that of the king of Chedi. O Yudhisthira! Madhava is the creator and the destroyer of the
four kinds of beings that exist in the three worlds." O descendant of the Bharata lineage! Having heard these
words, the king of Chedi replied to Bhishma in a harsh tone.'
