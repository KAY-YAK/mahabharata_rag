Janamejaya said, 'O sage! After having sent the brave Pandavas into exile, all these lamentations of King Dhritarashtra served no purpose. Why did the king agree with his son Duryodhana, whose intelligence is limited, and
anger Pandu's sons, the maharathas? What did Pandu's sons eat when they lived in the forest? Tell me whether it
was collected from the forest or cultivated.'

Vaishampayana replied, 'Those bulls among men ate what was obtained from the forest and animals brought
down with pure arrows, after having first offered it to the brahmanas. O king! When those great archers and warriors dwelt in the forest, brahmanas with fire[That is, brahmanas who maintained the sacrificial fire.], and those without fire, followed them there. There were ten thousand great-souled snataka brahmanas who knew about the means of salvation. Yudhishthira sustained them there.
After killing ruru deer, black antelopes and other sacrificial forest-dwelling animals with his bows, he offered them
to brahmanas in accordance with the rituals. Not a single ill-complexioned or diseased person could be seen there.
Nor was there anyone who was thin, weak, miserable or frightened. Dharmaraja Yudhishthira, supreme among the
Kouravas, maintained them like his beloved sons, relatives or brothers from the same womb. Like a mother, the
illustrious Droupadi first served her husbands, then all the brahmanas, and then ate whatever food remained. For
the sake of the meat of the deer, they wielded their bows and always made that race decay[That is, killed the deer.]-the king[Yudhishthira.] towards
the east, Bhimasena towards the south, the twins towards the west and also towards the north. Thus did they live in
Kamyaka and five years passed. They were without Arjuna and were anxious about him. They engaged themselves
in studying, meditating and sacrificing.'
