Vaishampayana said, 'The king who was Ambika's son was thus worshipped by the Pandavas. He found pleasure,
as in earlier times, and the rishis tended to him. The king who was Kunti's son, the extender of the Kuru lineage, gave everything that should be given to brahmanas. King Yudhishthira was affectionate and non-violent. The
lord of the earth told his brothers and advisers, "The lord of men[Dhritarashtra.] must be worshipped by me and you. A person
who follows Dhritarashtra's instructions is my well-wisher. A man who acts contrary to this is an enemy and will
go to hell." At the time of performing the funeral ceremonies for his sons, it was instructed that everything that the
king[Dhritarashtra.] desired should be given. The immensely intelligent Kouravya, King Dhritarashtra, gave brahmanas great
quantities of riches, just as they deserved. Dharmaraja, Bhima, Savyasachi and the twins-all of them followed
Dhritarashtra's instructions. How could the aged king suffer grief on account of his sons? They wished to ensure
that he did not die because of grief. They made sure that the foremost among the Kurus obtained all the objects of
pleasure that he enjoyed as long as his sons were alive. Together, all the five Pandava brothers followed this good
conduct and obeyed Dhritarashtra. Dhritarashtra saw that those brave ones were humble and always behaved with
modesty. He was like a preceptor surrounded by disciples. Gandhari performed all kinds of funeral ceremonies for
her sons and freed herself of her debt towards them, giving to brahmanas. In this way, Dharmaraja Yudhishthira,
intelligent and foremost among those who upheld dharma, together with his brothers, worshipped the king.'
