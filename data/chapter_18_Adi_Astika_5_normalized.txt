Souti said, 'I have told you the story of how the ambrosia was churned out from the ocean. From that, the handsome horse[Ucchaihshrava.] emerged, unparalleled in strength. When Kadru saw this horse, she asked Vinata, "My dear, what is
the colour of Ucchaihshrava? Tell me right away." Vinata replied, "Blessed one, the king of horses is white. What
colour do you think it is? Tell me what you think and we will have a wager." Kadru said, "O lady of the sweet
smiles! I think the horse has a black tail. O beautiful one! Let us have a wager that she whose words are false will
become the other one's slave." Thus, having laid a wager that one would be the slave of the other, they returned to
their home, resolving to examine the horse the next day.

'Wishing to deceive, Kadru asked her 1000 sons to become like hair as black as collyrium and speedily cover
the horse's tail, so that she did not become a slave. When they refused to do what they had been asked, she cursed
the snakes and said, "In the snake-sacrifice of the royal and wise sage Janamejaya, of the Pandava lineage[This should not cause confusion. The word Kourava is often used as opposite to Pandava. The Pandavas had
Pandu as their father. However, Kuru was a common ancestor to both brothers. Hence any Pandava, and anyone
descended from the Pandavas, can also be called Kourava.], the
fire will consume all of you." The grandfather[Brahma.] himself heard this extremely cruel curse uttered by Kadru, and
driven by destiny, bearing in mind the welfare of all creatures, since the snakes had greatly multiplied, he[Brahma.] and
the other gods approved the curse. The snakes had virulent poison, excessive strength and were mighty in prowess.
They had a tendency to bite. For the welfare of all creatures, to counter their virulent poison, he bestowed on the
great-souled Kashyapa the knowledge of neutralizing poison.'
