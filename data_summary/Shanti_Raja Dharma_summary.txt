Summary of Raja Dharma parva (under Shanti parva)

**Summary**

Yudhishthira asks Bhishma to explain how a king should conduct himself according to rajadharma (the duty of kings). Bhishma uses the example of a peacock to describe the qualities and behaviors a king should adopt. A king should be able to adapt to different situations, protect his kingdom, and use his intelligence to make decisions. He should also appoint wise people around him, follow the sacred texts, and treat everyone equally.

Bhishma explains that a king's prosperity depends on his ability to balance dharma (duty), artha (wealth), and kama (pleasure). A king who knows about time is the best among kings. He should not ignore his enemies but rather weaken them and protect his own stores.

Yudhishthira asks Bhishma to elaborate on rajadharma, and Bhishma explains that a king's duty is to protect all beings. He advises Yudhishthira to use his intelligence to follow the ordinances of dharma and to appoint wise people around him.

Bhishma then describes the rod of chastisement, which is the foundation of dharma. The rod has many different forms and is based on the customs through which the king exercises it. Bhishma explains that the rod is a limb of the kingdom and provides power.

Yudhishthira asks about the foundations of dharma, artha, and kama, and Bhishma explains that they are sometimes connected with each other and sometimes exist separately. He describes how good conduct can be ensured and its signs.

Bhishma then tells a story about Duryodhana's desire for prosperity like Yudhishthira's. Dhritarashtra advises him to follow good conduct, which involves non-violence towards all beings, compassion, and generosity.

Yudhishthira asks about hope and its nature, and Bhishma tells the story of Sumitra, who pursued a deer that was difficult to catch. The deer was eventually brought back by Tanu, a brahmana rishi who had been insulted by Sumitra's father.

Bhishma explains that good conduct is essential for a king and that hope can be a double-edged sword. He advises Yudhishthira to be firm like the Himalayas and not be tormented by his hopes.

Yudhishthira asks about dharma in times of distress, and Bhishma explains that there are different kinds of dharma for those who are capable and those in distress. He advises Yudhishthira to use his intelligence to decide what must be done in times of hardship.
