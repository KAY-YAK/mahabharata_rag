Summary of Araneya parva (under Aranyaka parva)

**Summary**

Janamejaya asks Vaishampayana about the Pandavas' experience after Krishna's abduction. Vaishampayana tells the story of how Yudhishthira and his brothers went to Dvaitavana, where they lived a simple life on fruit and vows. However, their efforts were soon disrupted by a brahmana who asked them to retrieve his kindling and churning rod from a deer that had taken it.

The Pandavas followed the deer's footprints but failed to catch it, leading to Nakula's death after he drank water from a lake without answering the yaksha's questions. The other brothers also died in similar circumstances, with Yudhishthira being the only one left alive.

Yudhishthira answered the yaksha's questions correctly and was granted a boon by Dharma, who revealed himself as the father of Yudhishthira. Dharma tested Yudhishthira's non-violence and ultimately granted him three boons: that his fires not be destroyed, that he remain unrecognized for the thirteenth year, and that he always conquer avarice, delusion, and anger.

The Pandavas then spent the thirteenth year in hiding, during which time they consulted with their advisors and prepared to face their enemies. The story concludes with the Pandavas setting out on their journey of concealment, ready to begin their sojourn in disguise.
