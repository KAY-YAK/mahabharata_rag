Summary of Poushya parva (under Adi parva)

**Summary**

The story revolves around Janamejaya, a prince who attends a long sacrifice in Kurukshetra with his brothers. A dog is beaten by them, and its mother, Sarama, comes to complain to Janamejaya. She curses him, saying that evil will befall him when he least expects it.

Janamejaya seeks the help of a priest named Shrutashrava to counteract the curse. He accepts his son Somashrava as his new priest and returns home.

Meanwhile, Ayoda-Dhoumya, a rishi, has three disciples: Upamanyu, Aruni, and Veda. Each disciple undergoes a trial to test their obedience and devotion to their preceptor.

Upamanyu is forbidden from eating certain foods but eventually eats the leaves of an arka tree, which makes him blind. He prays to the Ashvins for help, and they restore his sight.

Veda serves his preceptor faithfully and eventually receives complete knowledge and good fortune.

Utanka, another disciple of Ayoda-Dhoumya, is asked by his preceptor's wife to bring a pair of earrings from King Poushya as a gift. Utanka meets various obstacles on his journey but ultimately retrieves the earrings.

Upon returning home, Utanka seeks revenge against Takshaka, the king of the nagas, who had cast impediments in his path. He praises Indra and eventually returns to his preceptor's house with the earrings.

Janamejaya, the prince, is advised by Utanka to take vengeance on Takshaka for killing his father, Parikshit. Janamejaya becomes angry and decides to burn Takshaka in a snake-sacrifice.
