Summary of Ajagara parva (under Aranyaka parva)

**Summary**

Janamejaya asks Vaishampayana about the Pandavas' life in the forest after their reunion with Arjuna. Vaishampayana describes how they lived in a beautiful mountain, where they were comfortable and content. Bhima suggests that they should move elsewhere to deceive Duryodhana, but Yudhishthira is hesitant.

The Pandavas then leave the mountain and travel to various places, including Vrishaparva's hermitage, Badari, and Narayana's region. They meet King Subahu and his people, and later reach the river Yamuna.

Bhima goes hunting in the forest and encounters a giant serpent that has been cursed by Agastya. The serpent tells Bhima its story and explains how it became a serpent due to its own misdeeds. Yudhishthira then converses with the serpent, discussing various philosophical and moral ideas, including the nature of brahmanas, the importance of truthfulness and non-violence, and the characteristics of the mind and intelligence.

The serpent is eventually freed from its curse by Yudhishthira's conversation, and it returns to heaven. The Pandavas are then reunited with Bhima, who has been freed from fear.
