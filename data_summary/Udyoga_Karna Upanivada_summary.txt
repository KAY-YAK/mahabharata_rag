Summary of Karna Upanivada parva (under Udyoga parva)

**Summary**

Dhritarashtra asks Sanjaya to recount what Krishna told Karna before he left. Sanjaya tells Dhritarashtra that Krishna offered Karna a kingdom, but Karna refused, saying that the Pandavas would win the war and that he could not betray Duryodhana's trust. 

Krishna then spoke to Karna again, trying to persuade him to join the Pandavas, but Karna remained loyal to Duryodhana. Sanjaya tells Dhritarashtra that Krishna left the Kurus and went to the Pandavas.

Meanwhile, Kunti goes to meet Karna on the banks of the Ganga, where she reveals her true identity as his mother and tries to persuade him to join the Pandavas. However, Karna refuses, saying that he cannot abandon Duryodhana's side and that he will fight against the Pandavas.

Krishna then tells the Pandavas about his conversation with Karna, and they discuss their next move. Yudhishthira asks Krishna to recount what happened in the assembly hall of the Kurus, where Bhishma, Drona, Vidura, Gandhari, and Dhritarashtra tried to persuade Duryodhana to give up the kingdom.
