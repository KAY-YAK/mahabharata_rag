**Summary**

Vaishampayana narrates a story about King Yudhishthira's desire to perform the rajasuya sacrifice. Krishna advises him to defeat Jarasandha, a powerful king who has conquered many kingdoms, before performing the sacrifice. The Pandavas disguise themselves as brahmanas and enter Magadha city, where they meet Jarasandha. Bhima challenges Jarasandha to a duel, but Krishna advises him to hold back and not press down on Jarasandha when he's weakened. Bhima seizes Jarasandha and breaks his back into two.

After defeating Jarasandha, the Pandavas go to Indraprastha, where they meet Yudhishthira and celebrate their victory over Jarasandha. Krishna then instates Jarasandha's son as the new king of Magadha and leaves with Bhima and Arjuna.

The story also describes the conquests of the Pandavas in various directions after they obtained the supreme bow from Partha (Arjuna). Arjuna sets out to conquer the region protected by Dhanada (Kubera), while Bhima, Sahadeva, and Nakula set out in different directions with their armies.

The story also revolves around Yudhishthira's rajasuya sacrifice, where many kings come to attend and pay homage to him. After the sacrifice is completed, Krishna seeks permission from Yudhishthira to return to Dvaraka.
