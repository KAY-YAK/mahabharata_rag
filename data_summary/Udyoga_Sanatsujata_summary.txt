Summary of Sanatsujata parva (under Udyoga parva)

**Summary**

Vaishampayana narrates a conversation between King Dhritarashtra and Sanatsujata, a wise man. Dhritarashtra asks about death and immortality, and Sanatsujata explains that both exist and do not exist at the same time. He says that confusion is death, and immortality is where there is no confusion. Sanatsujata also talks about dharma (righteousness) and adharma (wrongdoing), saying that dharma is stronger than its opposite.

Dhritarashtra asks about brahmanas (priests) who follow dharma, and Sanatsujata describes the qualities of a true brahmana. He says that a brahmana should be humble, not proud of his strength or wealth, and should control his desires. A true brahmana is one who knows the Vedas and has not deviated from the truth.

Dhritarashtra asks about the Vedas, and Sanatsujata explains that there is only one Veda, but many people have misunderstood it as being multiple. He says that the true Veda is the knowledge of the brahman (the ultimate reality).

Sanatsujata then describes how to obtain immortality through brahmacharya (self-control) and the practice of austerities. He explains that one should conquer their desires, establish themselves on the brahman, and pluck the soul out of the body like a stalk of munja grass.
