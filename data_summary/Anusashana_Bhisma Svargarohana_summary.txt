Summary of Bhisma Svargarohana parva (under Anusashana parva)

**Summary**

Vaishampayana narrates that after the war, Yudhishthira, the king who was Pandu's son, consoled the women who had lost their husbands and gave them riches. The wise Yudhishthira then returned to his kingdom. Bhishma, the king who was Kunti's son, lay on a bed of arrows for 58 nights, waiting for the right time to die. When Yudhishthira arrived with his brothers and priests, Bhishma spoke to them, telling them that it was time for him to leave. He asked them to grant him permission to cast aside his breath of life.

Bhishma then controlled his breath and released it upwards, and the wounds on his body disappeared. His soul pierced his head and ascended towards heaven. The Pandavas and Vidura prepared a funeral pyre for Bhishma, and he was cremated according to the prescribed ordinances. The goddess Bhagirathi, who was Bhishma's mother, arose from the water and lamented her son's death. However, Krishna comforted her, telling her that Bhishma had obtained supreme success and should not be grieved over.
