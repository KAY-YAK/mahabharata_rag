Summary of Bhishma Abhishechana parva (under Udyoga parva)

**Summary**

The text describes the events leading up to the war between the Pandavas and the Kauravas. Dhritarashtra's son Duryodhana asks Bhishma, a wise and powerful warrior, to lead their army as general. Bhishma agrees but says he will not fight against his grandsons, the Pandavas. Duryodhana then consecrates Bhishma as the general and makes preparations for war.

Meanwhile, Yudhishthira, the leader of the Pandavas, summons seven leaders to lead their army and chooses Drupada, Virata, and others to be their generals. The Pandavas also prepare for war, with Arjuna being made the lord of the generals and Balarama being made his guide.

Rukmi, a prince from Vidarbha, arrives at the Pandava camp and offers to help them in battle. However, he is rebuffed by Yudhishthira, who says that he does not need Rukmi's help. Rukmi then returns to Duryodhana and offers his services again, but is also rejected.

The text then describes how the soldiers and battle formations are marshalled in Kurukshetra, with Dhritarashtra speaking to Sanjaya about the impending war and its consequences. Sanjaya advises Dhritarashtra not to blame destiny or time for the war, but rather to take responsibility for his own actions.
