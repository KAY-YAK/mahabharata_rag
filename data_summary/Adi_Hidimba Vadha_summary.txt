Summary of Hidimba Vadha parva (under Adi parva)

**Summary**

The story begins with Vaishampayana describing a rakshasa named Hidimba who lives in a forest and is cruel, addicted to human flesh, and very powerful. He sees the Pandavas sleeping in the forest and tells his sister to kill them so they can eat their flesh. However, his sister falls in love with Bhima and decides not to obey her brother's orders.

Bhima and Hidimba engage in a conversation where she tries to convince him to marry her, but he refuses, citing his duty to his family. The rakshasa Hidimba then arrives on the scene, furious at his sister for disobeying him. Bhima challenges him to a fight and eventually kills him.

The story then shifts to Hidimba, who is now in love with Bhima and wants to marry him. She pleads with Kunti to allow her to be with Bhima, citing the righteous path of preserving oneself from disaster. Yudhishthira agrees, but only if Bhima has bathed and performed his ablutions.

Hidimba then takes Bhima away and they spend their days in various beautiful locations, including mountain peaks, forests, and lakes. She gives birth to a son named Ghatotkacha, who is an immensely powerful rakshasa.

The story concludes with the Pandavas meeting their grandfather, Vyasa, who comforts them and tells them that they will rule over the kingdom of their father and grandfathers. He also predicts that Yudhishthira will rule righteously and conquer the entire earth.
