**Summary**

The story begins with Janamejaya asking Vaishampayana about the fate of his great-grandfathers who obtained heaven after their death. Yudhishthira sees Duryodhana in heaven but is filled with intolerance towards him due to past grievances. Narada intervenes and explains that enmity is destroyed in heaven. Yudhishthira then asks about his brothers who were killed in the battle, and he faces a test by going through a terrible place where they are suffering. He realizes that these voices are actually the spirits of his brothers testing him. After showing compassion towards them, Dharma tells Yudhishthira that he has passed the third test. Yudhishthira then sees his brothers in heaven, each in their own station based on their deeds.
