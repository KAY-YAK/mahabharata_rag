Summary of Jambukhanda Vinirmana parva (under Bhishma parva)

**Summary**

Janamejaya asks Vaishampayana about the Kurus' battle in Kurukshetra. Vaishampayana describes how the Pandavas, Somakas, and Kouravas prepared for war, with each side having its own rules of dharma to be followed during the conflict. The sage Vyasa, who possesses divine eyesight, is asked by Dhritarashtra to describe the battle to him instead of witnessing it himself. Sanjaya is granted a boon by Vyasa to see and recount the entire battle from afar.

Dhritarashtra asks Sanjaya about the earth's qualities and the island of Sudarshana, which is described as being circular in shape with rivers, mountains, and cities. The mountain Meru is said to be 84,000 yojanas high and deep, with four islands along its sides. Sanjaya describes various varshas (continents) and their inhabitants, including the gods, gandharvas, asuras, rakshasas, and apsaras.

Dhritarashtra asks about Bharatavarsha, where the senseless army has gathered, and is told that it is loved by Indra and other powerful kshatriyas. Sanjaya describes the seven noble mountains in Bharatavarsha, including Mahendra, Malaya, Shuktiman, Rikshavan, Vindhya, Pariyatra, and others.
