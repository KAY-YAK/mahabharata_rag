Summary of Dana Dharma parva (under Anusashana parva)

**Summary**

The text describes various stories of brahmanas who are considered superior in their respective lineages. The king asks Bhishma to tell him about another kshatriya who is superior to these two brahmanas. Vayu tells the king about Kashyapa, a brahmana who controlled his body and entered the ground, where he remained for 30,000 divine years, bringing peace and dharma to the earth. The earth then bowed down before Kashyapa and became his daughter.

Vayu also tells the story of Utathya, a brahmana born in the lineage of Angiras, who was married to Soma's daughter Bhadra. Varuna, the lord of the waters, abducted her, but Utathya eventually recovered his wife with the help of Narada and his own powers.

The text then describes various other stories of brahmanas, including Agastya, Vasishtha, Atri, Chyavana, and Durvasa. These brahmanas are known for their great deeds and austerities, which they use to protect the gods and the universe from harm.

Bhishma is asked by Yudhishthira about the importance of worshipping brahmanas. Bhishma explains that brahmanas are superior beings who possess knowledge and energy, and that they should be treated with respect and honor. He tells Yudhishthira about his own experiences with Durvasa, a powerful brahmana who was known for his fierce nature.

The text also describes the importance of following dharma and the consequences of censuring it. Bhishma explains that those who follow dharma are virtuous and enjoy heaven, while those who hate dharma go to hell. He tells Yudhishthira about the different types of people, including wicked individuals who cannot be disciplined, and virtuous people who possess good conduct.

The text concludes with a list of names of brahmanas and rajarshis who are revered by the gods. Bhishma recites these names to Yudhishthira, telling him that reciting them will free one from all sins.
