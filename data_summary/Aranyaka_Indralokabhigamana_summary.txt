Summary of Indralokabhigamana parva (under Aranyaka parva)

**Summary**

The story revolves around King Nala and his wife Damayanti. They were separated when Nala was forced to abandon her due to the evil spirit Kali, but he eventually regained his kingdom and reunited with Damayanti. However, their happiness was short-lived as they encountered another challenge in the form of Pushkara, who challenged Nala to a game of dice. Despite being defeated, Nala showed mercy and spared Pushkara's life.

Meanwhile, Arjuna (Savyasachi) left the Kamyaka forest, leaving his brothers Yudhishthira, Bhima, Nakula, and Sahadeva behind. They were unhappy without him and remembered his bravery in battles. Droupadi, in particular, was affected by Arjuna's absence.
