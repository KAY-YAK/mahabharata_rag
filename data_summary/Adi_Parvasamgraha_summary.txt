**Summary**

The text describes a conversation between Souti and the sages about the holy region of Samantapanchaka. The sages ask Souti to describe the place, which he does by telling stories about its history. He explains how Parashurama, a great warrior, destroyed all Kshatriyas and created five lakes of blood in Samantapanchaka. After that, the region became famous as a holy land.
