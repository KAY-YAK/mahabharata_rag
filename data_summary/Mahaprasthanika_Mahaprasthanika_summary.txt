Summary of Mahaprasthanika parva (under Mahaprasthanika parva)

**Summary**

Janamejaya asked Vaishampayana about what the Pandavas did after hearing about Krishna's ascension to heaven and the duel between the Vrishnis and Andhakas. Vaishampayana replied that King Kourava (Dhritarashtra) decided to give up his life, but Arjuna agreed with him. The Pandavas then decided to depart and handed over their kingdom to Yuyutsu. They donned the bark of trees as garments and performed rituals before leaving Hastinapura.

The Pandavas traveled through various countries, rivers, and mountains, following the dharma of renunciation. Along the way, they encountered Agni (the god of fire) who asked them to return Gandiva (Arjuna's bow) to Varuna. Arjuna eventually cast aside the bow and quivers into the water.

As they continued their journey, Yudhishthira's brothers fell down on the ground due to various reasons: Droupadi for her partiality towards Arjuna, Sahadeva for his pride in being wise, Nakula for thinking he was unmatched in beauty, and Arjuna for disrespecting other bow wielders.

Yudhishthira was overcome with grief but refused to leave his brothers behind. He told Indra that the dog (who was actually Dharma in disguise) should be allowed to accompany him to heaven. Indra tried to persuade Yudhishthira to abandon the dog, citing the sin of abandoning someone devoted, but Yudhishthira refused.

Dharma, pleased with Yudhishthira's compassion and integrity, praised him for his noble lineage, intelligence, and compassion towards all beings. Dharma then made Pandava ascend the chariot of the gods, which took him to heaven in his own body.
