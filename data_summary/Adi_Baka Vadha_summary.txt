Summary of Baka Vadha parva (under Adi parva)

**Summary**:

The story begins with Janamejaya asking about the Pandavas' actions after they arrived at Ekachakra. Vaishampayana tells him that the Pandavas lived in a Brahmana's house for a short while, begged for alms, and became favourites of the citizens. The Brahmana's wife, Kunti, divided their alms among them.

One day, when Bhima was at home with Kunti, they heard a great uproar in the Brahmana's house. Kunti suggested that Bhima try to find out what the distress was and how it had arisen. They discovered that the Brahmana's family was being terrorized by a rakshasa.

The Brahmana said that he would rather die than sacrifice his wife or daughter, but his wife convinced him to let her go in order to save their family. The daughter then spoke up and suggested that she be sacrificed instead of her parents.

Kunti proposed a solution: one of the Pandavas could volunteer to go and feed the rakshasa, allowing the Brahmana's family to escape. Bhima agreed to do it, and Kunti convinced Yudhishthira not to object.

Bhima went to the forest where the rakshasa lived and ate the food meant for him, ignoring the rakshasa's threats. The rakshasa became enraged and attacked Bhima, but he was unharmed and continued eating. Eventually, the rakshasa was overcome by fatigue and Bhima killed him.

After killing the rakshasa, Bhima returned to the Brahmana's house and told them about his actions. The next morning, the citizens of Ekachakra saw the dead rakshasa and were amazed by Bhima's feat.
