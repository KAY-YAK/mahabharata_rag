Summary of Astika parva (under Adi parva)

**Summary**

The text is an ancient Indian scripture that tells several stories connected by their association with King Janamejaya's snake-sacrifice. The story begins with Shounaka asking Souti about the origin of the name Jaratkaru, which refers to a great-souled rishi who decayed his body slowly through severe austerities. Souti explains that "Jara" means decay and "karu" means gigantic.

The text then shifts to tell a story about King Parikshit, who pierces a deer with an arrow but is unable to find it in the forest. He meets a hermit who is under a vow of silence and becomes angry when the hermit doesn't respond. Eventually, Parikshit returns home, and the hermit's son, Shringi, learns about his father's encounter with the king.

Shringi curses King Parikshit to be killed by Takshaka, the king of snakes, within seven nights. However, Kashyapa, a brahmarshi, is on his way to visit the king and tries to cure him from the fever caused by Takshaka's poison. Takshaka disguises himself as an old Brahmana and tries to prevent Kashyapa from reviving the king.

The story then shifts to King Janamejaya, who asks his ministers about his father's death. The ministers tell him that Parikshit was killed by Takshaka in a snake-sacrifice performed by Janamejaya himself. However, Astika, the son of Jaratkaru and Vasuki's sister, intervenes and pleads with King Janamejaya to stop the sacrifice.

King Janamejaya agrees to grant Astika a boon, but Astika refuses to accept anything except for the sacrifice to be stopped. The king then grants Astika his wish, and the snake-sacrifice comes to an end. Takshaka is saved from being burned in the fire, and King Janamejaya gifts riches to Astika and the other participants of the sacrifice.
