Summary of Arjuna Vanavasa parva (under Adi parva)

**Summary**

Janamejaya asks Vaishampayana to tell him about the Pandavas' ancestors and their behavior after obtaining the kingdom of Indraprastha. Vaishampayana tells Janamejaya that Yudhishthira, the eldest of the five brothers, ruled over the earth with his brothers, following dharma (law or virtue). The brothers were known for their truthfulness and kindness towards their citizens.

One day, a divine sage named Narada visits the Pandavas. He warns them about the dangers of dissension among themselves, citing the example of two asura brothers, Sunda and Upasunda, who killed each other over desire for a beautiful woman named Tilottama. Narada tells the story of how Sunda and Upasunda obtained boons from Brahma, which ultimately led to their downfall.

The Pandavas are instructed by Narada to establish a rule among themselves to prevent dissension. They decide that if any one of them sets eyes on Droupadi when she is with another brother, he will retire to the forest and observe brahmacharya (celibacy) for twelve years.

Arjuna, one of the Pandavas, breaks this rule by entering a room where Yudhishthira is lying with Krishna. Arjuna decides to leave the kingdom and observes his vow in the forest for twelve years, accompanied by many brahmanas and other followers.

During his time in the forest, Arjuna visits various sacred places of pilgrimage, including the source of the Ganga river. He meets a serpent-maiden named Ulupi, who tries to seduce him but he resists her advances due to his vow of celibacy. However, he eventually gives in and spends the night with her.

Arjuna then visits various other sacred places, including Soubhadra, where he encounters four apsaras who have been cursed by a brahmana to become crocodiles. Arjuna frees them from their curse and they regain their human forms.

Finally, Arjuna meets Krishna in Prabhasa and they spend some time together, watching actors and dancers and enjoying each other's company.
