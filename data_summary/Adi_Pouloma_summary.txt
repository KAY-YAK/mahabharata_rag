Summary of Pouloma parva (under Adi parva)

**Summary**

The story revolves around Ruru, a Brahmana who takes a vow to kill every snake he sees after his wife is bitten by one. However, when he encounters an old dundubha (a non-poisonous snake), it tells him its story and advises Ruru not to kill it. The dundubha explains that it was once a rishi named Sahasrapata who was cursed by a Brahmana friend for creating a mock snake out of blades of grass to frighten him.

The dundubha then asks Ruru to listen to the history of Astika, a powerful Brahmana who saved frightened snakes during King Janamejaya's sacrifice. The story is eventually told by Souti, a suta (a learned man), at the Naimisharanya sacrifice. Souti recounts the tale of Chyavana, the son of Bhrigu, and his birth after Puloma was carried away by a rakshasa named Puloman.

The story also tells of Agni's curse by Bhrigu for revealing Puloma as his wife to Puloman. However, Brahma intervenes and instructs Agni to accept the gods' share and his own when offered into his mouth. The story continues with Ruru falling in love with Pramadvara, a beautiful girl adopted by Sthulakesha, and her eventual death after being bitten by a snake.

Ruru's grief is alleviated when he is told that he can bring back Pramadvara to life if he gives up half of his own life. Ruru agrees, and Pramadvara returns to life with half of his life. They get married on the designated day, and Ruru takes a vow to destroy snakes.
