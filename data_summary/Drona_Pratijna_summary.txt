Summary of Pratijna parva (under Drona parva)

**Summary**

The text describes a series of events leading up to the battle between Arjuna (Dhananjaya) and Jayadratha. Sanjaya narrates the story, explaining that Jayadratha is frightened by Arjuna's vow to kill him after he killed Abhimanyu, the son of Subhadra and Arjuna. Jayadratha seeks protection from Duryodhana and his brothers, who promise to protect him with their army.

Drona advises Saindhava (Jayadratha) that he is equal to Arjuna in skills but superior due to yoga and hardships faced. He tells Saindhava not to be afraid of Arjuna and that he will be protected by Drona's arms. However, Arjuna vows to kill Jayadratha, stating that no one can counter his pledge.

Krishna (Vasudeva) consoles Subhadra, who is grieving over the death of her son Abhimanyu. He tells her that Arjuna will kill Jayadratha and that their lineage will also attain a similar end. The night before the battle, Arjuna meditates on Shiva (Bhava), seeking his divine pashupata weapon to fulfill his pledge.

Arjuna and Krishna travel through the sky with Shiva's attendants, witnessing various sacred places and mountains. They reach Mount Kala, where they see Shiva seated with Parvati and other radiant beings. Arjuna and Krishna worship Shiva, seeking his boon and the pashupata weapon.

Shiva grants them the pashupata weapon and tells them to bring it back. Arjuna and Krishna return to their camp, filled with joy and excitement for the battle ahead.

The next morning, Yudhishthira wakes up, performs his ablutions, and meets with his well-wishers, including Krishna and Satyaki (Yuyudhana). He asks them about their welfare and honors them with worship. Arjuna arrives, having spent the night with Keshava, and tells him about his encounter with Shiva.

Krishna reassures Yudhishthira that Arjuna will kill Jayadratha and that he will be victorious in the battle. The Pandavas prepare for war, with Krishna and Satyaki on a single chariot, ready to face the enemy.
