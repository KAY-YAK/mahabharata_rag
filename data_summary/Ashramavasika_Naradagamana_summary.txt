Summary of Naradagamana parva (under Ashramavasika parva)

**Summary**:

The story begins with Vaishampayana telling King Dhritarashtra's son Yudhishthira about the death of his father, who had been living in a forest hermitage for three years. Narada, a wise man, had visited Yudhishthira and told him that Dhritarashtra had died by voluntarily allowing himself to be burnt down in a forest conflagration while performing severe austerities.

Yudhishthira was grief-stricken upon hearing this news and lamented the death of his father. He questioned how someone as powerful as Dhritarashtra, who had many sons and was a great king, could die in such a way. Narada explained that Dhritarashtra had entered the forest to perform severe austerities and had kindled a sacrificial fire, which eventually consumed him.

The Pandavas were overcome with grief upon hearing this news, but Narada comforted them by explaining that Dhritarashtra's death was not futile, as he had voluntarily allowed himself to be burnt down. He also told Yudhishthira that his mother, Pritha, had been devoted to serving her seniors and had obtained a great success.

The story then describes the funeral rites performed for Dhritarashtra and his wives, Gandhari and Pritha. The inhabitants of the city and countryside immersed themselves in the Ganga River as a sign of respect, and the Pandavas performed the cremation rites according to tradition.
