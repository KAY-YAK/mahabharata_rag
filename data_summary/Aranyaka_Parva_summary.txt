Summary of Aranyaka parva. This is the summary of main parva, Aranyaka parva.

**Summary**

The text describes various stories from the Mahabharata, an ancient Indian epic. The stories revolve around the Pandavas, a group of five brothers, and their experiences during their exile in the forest.

In the first story, Janamejaya asks Vaishampayana to recount the tale of the Pandavas' exile. Yudhishthira is hesitant to leave Gajasahrya due to his misfortunes, but eventually decides to seek refuge with Surya and perform austerities.

In another story, Dhritarashtra asks Vidura about Bhima's encounter with Kirmira, a terrifying rakshasa. The Pandavas enter the forest of Kamyaka at night and meet Kirmira, who threatens to eat them up. Bhima fights Kirmira using a tree as a weapon and eventually kills him.

The text also describes how Arjuna obtains divine weapons from Indra. He meets an ascetic (who turns out to be Indra) under a tree at Indrakila mountain and requests the knowledge of all weapons. However, Indra tells him that he must first see Lord Shiva before obtaining the divine weapons.

The story of Nala and Damayanti is also told, where they are separated due to the evil spirit Kali but eventually reunite. Their happiness is short-lived as they encounter another challenge in the form of Pushkara, who challenges Nala to a game of dice.

Bhima's encounter with Hanuman is described, where he meets the giant monkey and learns about dharma from him. Bhima also kills Jatasura, a rakshasa who abducts Yudhishthira, Nakula, and Droupadi while Bhimasena is away hunting.

The text further describes Arjuna's battle with the nivatakavachas, where he uses his divine chariot and arrows to kill them. He also attacks Hiranyapura, a city inhabited by Poulamas and Kalakeyas who are protected by a boon from Brahma.

Janamejaya asks Vaishampayana about the Pandavas' life in the forest after their reunion with Arjuna. Vaishampayana describes how they lived in a beautiful mountain, where they were comfortable and content. Bhima suggests that they should move elsewhere to deceive Duryodhana, but Yudhishthira is hesitant.

The story of Savitri and Satyavan is also told, where Savitri chooses Satyavan as her husband despite his short life expectancy. She lives in the forest with him and his parents, performing austerities and satisfying everyone's needs. However, when Satyavan's death approaches, Savitri observes a vow of fasting and remains standing for three nights to prevent him from dying.
