Summary of Moksha Dharma parva (under Shanti parva)

**Summary**

Janamejaya asks Vaishampayana about the dharma (path to righteousness) that leads to Narayana, a supreme god. Vaishampayana explains that Narayana accepts offerings from those who are single-minded in their devotion and follows the ordinances. He tells Janamejaya about the origins of this dharma, which was first thought of by Narayana himself.

The dharma is passed down through various beings, including Brahma, Rudra, and Suparna, before being obtained by the wind god Vayu. It then disappears again and merges into Narayana. Vaishampayana explains that this dharma is difficult to comprehend and practice but those who follow it are emancipated.

Janamejaya asks about the different kinds of knowledge, including sankhya, yoga, pancharatra, and pashupata. Vaishampayana replies that all these forms of knowledge speak of devotion to Narayana as the ultimate goal.

Bhishma tells Janamejaya a story about a brahmana who is confused about which dharma to follow. He seeks advice from a guest who recommends that he visit Padmanabha, a serpent who lives in Mahapadma city. The brahmana meets Padmanabha's wife and waits for him to return.

When Padmanabha returns, his wife tells him about the brahmana and his desire to meet him. Padmanabha goes to meet the brahmana and they have a conversation about dharma. The brahmana asks Padmanabha about the truth and how to accumulate merit. Padmanabha tells him about a wonder he witnessed, where a sage merged into Surya's energy.

The brahmana is delighted by this story and decides to follow the vow of unchha (subsisting on leftovers). He then honors Padmanabha and seeks his permission to leave. The serpent replies that the gods are not superior to him in any way, and that everyone can go everywhere.
