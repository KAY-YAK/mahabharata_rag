Summary of Kairata parva (under Aranyaka parva)

**Summary**

Vaishampayana narrates a story about Dharmaraja Yudhishthira instructing his brother Arjuna on how to obtain the divine weapons from Indra. Arjuna follows his brother's instructions, performs austerities, and meets an ascetic (who turns out to be Indra) under a tree at Indrakila mountain. Indra asks Arjuna to choose a boon, which he requests as the knowledge of all weapons. However, Indra tells Arjuna that he must first see Lord Shiva before obtaining the divine weapons.

Arjuna then meets Lord Shiva in his form as a hunter and engages in a fierce battle with him. Despite being exhausted, Arjuna continues to fight, but is eventually subdued by Shiva's powers. Shiva is pleased with Arjuna's bravery and grants him the pashupata weapon, which is capable of destroying entire worlds.

Shiva then teaches Arjuna how to use the pashupata weapon and gives it to him as a boon. The earth trembles at the moment when Arjuna receives the weapon, and various gods and goddesses arrive on the scene to witness the event. Yama, Varuna, Kubera, and Indra all give Arjuna their divine weapons, including the staff of Yama, Varuna's noose, Kubera's antardhana, and Indra's chariot.
