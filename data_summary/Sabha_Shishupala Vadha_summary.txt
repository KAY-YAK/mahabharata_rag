Summary of Shishupala Vadha parva (under Sabha parva)

**Summary**

The story revolves around Shishupala, a king who is known for his evil intentions towards Krishna. He insults Bhishma, calling him old and foolish, and accuses him of being biased towards Krishna. However, Bhishma reveals the past of Shishupala, telling how he was born with three eyes and four arms, but was cured by Krishna when placed on his lap. Despite this, Shishupala continues to insult Krishna and is eventually killed by him in a fit of anger.

The story then shifts to the rajasuya sacrifice, where many kings come to attend and pay homage to Yudhishthira. After the sacrifice is completed, the kings depart, and Vasudeva (Krishna) seeks permission from Yudhishthira to return to Dvaraka. Krishna says goodbye to his family members and departs, leaving behind only Duryodhana and Shakuni.
