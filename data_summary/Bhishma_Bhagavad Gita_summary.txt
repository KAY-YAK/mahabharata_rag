Summary of Bhagavad Gita parva (under Bhishma parva)

**Summary**

The text discusses yoga and its practice as described by Lord Krishna to Arjuna. A yogi performs actions without attachment to their outcomes and controls their mind and senses. They should be tranquil, focus on their atman (self), treat everyone equally, and look upon everything with an equal eye. The lord says that yoga is difficult for someone whose mind is uncontrolled but can be achieved through practice and detachment.

The text also talks about the importance of self-control and the need to pacify one's atman. A yogi should not eat too much or too little, sleep too much or stay awake too much. They should be measured in their food and movement and make special effort to control their mind.

Lord Krishna explains that a person who has deviated from the path of yoga can attain the worlds of the righteous but will eventually be born again in a righteous household. He advises Arjuna to become a yogi and worship him with his self immersed in him.

The text concludes by saying that a yogi is superior to those who practise austerities, are learned, or perform action. The lord says that he who is devoted and worships him, with his self immersed in him, is the most accomplished among all yogis.
