Summary of Putra Darshana parva (under Ashramavasika parva)

**Summary**

Janamejaya asks Vaishampayana about the events that occurred after the Kurukshetra war. Vyasa arrives at the hermitage where Dhritarashtra, Yudhishthira, and other members of their families are residing in the forest. The conversation between Vyasa and the family members is a divine discussion about dharma, ancient rishis, gods, and asuras.

Vyasa offers to grant boons to Dhritarashtra, who asks to know what happened to his sons and grandsons who were killed in the war. Gandhari and Kunti also express their desire to know about their loved ones. Vyasa explains that the family members will be able to see their deceased relatives at the Ganga river.

The family members proceed to the Ganga, where they witness the reappearance of their loved ones from the dead. The warriors who had fought in the war arise from the water, and the family members meet each other with joy and affection.

After witnessing this wonder, the family members return to their hermitage, and Vyasa grants boons to Janamejaya, allowing him to see his father Parikshit in his former form. Janamejaya is delighted and asks Vaishampayana about the remaining part of the account.

Vaishampayana explains that Dhritarashtra sees his sons again and is freed from his grief. He then grants permission for Yudhishthira to leave with his brothers and followers, as they have dwelled in the forest for over a month. The Pandavas depart, and Dhritarashtra engages in severe austerities.
