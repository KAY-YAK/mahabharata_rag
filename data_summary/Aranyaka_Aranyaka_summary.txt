Summary of Aranyaka parva (under Aranyaka parva)

**Summary**

Janamejaya asks Vaishampayana to recount the story of the Pandavas and their exile in the forest. The Pandavas were defeated at a game of dice by the sons of Dhritarashtra and his advisors, and they left Gajasahrya with their followers. They reached the banks of the Jahnavi river, where they spent the night under a banyan tree.

The next morning, the brahmanas who had followed them asked to join them on their journey, but Yudhishthira was hesitant due to his own misfortunes and the difficulties that lay ahead. Shounaka, a learned brahmana, advised Yudhishthira to seek refuge with the sun god, Surya, and to perform austerities to sustain himself and his followers.

Yudhishthira then asked Dhoumya, his priest, for advice on how to support the brahmanas. Dhoumya told him that great-souled kings save their subjects by resorting to great austerities, yoga, and meditation. Yudhishthira undertook supreme austerities, worshipping Surya with offerings of flowers and fireless oblations.

Meanwhile, Dhritarashtra was tormented by his memories of Vidura's words and fell unconscious in the presence of the lords of the earth. Sanjaya was sent to bring Vidura back, and after being reunited with Dhritarashtra, Vidura forgave him and advised him to make peace with the Pandavas.

However, Duryodhana was angry at Vidura's return and plotted to kill the Pandavas. Vyasa appeared and counseled Dhritarashtra to restrain his son and bring him back to the path of pacification. He also sent Maitreya, a great sage, to instruct Duryodhana in the ways of peace.
