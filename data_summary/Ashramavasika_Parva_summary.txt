The story revolves around King Dhritarashtra, who lives in exile after a war. Great sages visit him, and he engages in conversations about dharma (righteousness).

Later, Vyasa arrives at the hermitage and explains the nature of Dharma (righteousness) to Dhritarashtra.

After the Kurukshetra war, Janamejaya asks Vaishampayana about the events that occurred next. Vyasa grants boons to Dhritarashtra, allowing him to see his deceased relatives at the Ganga river. The family members witness the reappearance of their loved ones from the dead and meet each other with joy.
