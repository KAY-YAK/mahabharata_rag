Summary of Yana Sandhi parva (under Udyoga parva)

**Summary**

The king of Hastinapura, Dhritarashtra, asks his charioteer Sanjaya to describe the army assembled for the Pandavas. Sanjaya lists many kings and warriors who have joined the Pandavas, including Krishna, Satyaki, Drupada, Virata, and others. Dhritarashtra is worried about his sons' chances in battle and believes that the powerful Bhima will lead the Pandavas to victory.

Duryodhana, Dhritarashtra's son, argues that the Kauravas have a strong army and that their enemies are not invincible. He claims that the grandfather (Bhishma), Drona, Kripa, Karna, Jayadratha, Somadatta, and Ashvatthama are all great archers who will lead the Kauravas to victory.

Dhritarashtra is unconvinced by his son's words and believes that the Pandavas have a strong army led by Yudhishthira. He asks Sanjaya to describe the efforts of the Pandavas, who are great archers and flaming warriors.

Sanjaya describes how Dhrishtadyumna incites the Pandavas to fight and tells them that he will restrain their enemies in battle. King Yudhishthira praises Dhrishtadyumna's bravery and asks him to save the Panchalas and Pandavas from the Kauravas.

Duryodhana argues that the gods are on his side and that he can defeat the Pandavas. He claims that he is superior to the Pandavas and that they will be destroyed in battle.

Karna, a great warrior, promises to kill the Panchalas, Karushas, and Matsyas in an instant. However, Bhishma warns Karna that once the foremost ones have been killed, Dhritarashtra's sons will be dead.

Dhritarashtra tries to persuade his son Duryodhana to make peace with the Pandavas, but Duryodhana refuses. The king then asks Sanjaya to describe the strengths and weaknesses of both armies. Sanjaya tells Dhritarashtra that Vasudeva (Krishna) is the supreme lord of all beings and that he will destroy Dhritarashtra's sons in battle.
