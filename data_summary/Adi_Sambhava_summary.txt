Summary of Sambhava parva (under Adi parva)

**Summary**

King Pratipa meditated on the banks of the Ganga River for many years. A beautiful woman named Ganga arose from the waters and asked him to accept her as his wife, but he refused due to his vow to follow dharma (righteous conduct) and not engage in relationships with women who were not equal to him in varna (social class). He accepted her as his daughter-in-law instead.

Ganga disappeared, and Pratipa's son Shantanu was born. When Shantanu grew up, Pratipa told him that if a beautiful woman came to him in secret and desired him for offspring, he should not question her about who she is or what she does. Shantanu met Ganga again on the banks of the Ganga River and fell in love with her.

Ganga agreed to be Shantanu's wife but warned him that he must never interfere in her actions or speak harshly to her. She also told him that she would leave him if he did not follow this rule. They had eight sons together, but Ganga threw each of them into the Ganga River, saying it was for their own good.

When Shantanu asked Ganga to spare their eighth son, she revealed that she was actually Ganga, a goddess, and had lived with Shantanu to accomplish the wishes of the gods and free eight vasus from a curse imposed by Vasishtha. She left Shantanu, leaving him to raise their son Gangadatta.

Shantanu's son Bhishma grew up to be a great warrior and was known for his bravery and dharma (righteous conduct). He took a vow of brahmacharya (celibacy) to ensure the continuation of the Kuru dynasty. Satyavati, Shantanu's wife, asked Bhishma to marry her daughters-in-law and have children with them to preserve the lineage.

Bhishma refused, citing his vow of brahmacharya, but eventually agreed to allow Vyasa (his half-brother) to father sons on Vichitravirya's field. Satyavati thought of Vyasa and asked him to produce sons who would carry forward their lineage. Vyasa agreed to do so, but only if the queens observed a rigid vow.
