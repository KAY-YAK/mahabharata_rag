Summary of Mahaprasthanika parva. This is the summary of main parva, Mahaprasthanika parva.

**Summary**

Janamejaya asks Vaishampayana about the Pandavas' actions after Krishna's ascension to heaven. Vaishampayana tells him that King Kourava decides to give up his life, but Arjuna agrees with him. The Pandavas then leave Hastinapura and hand over their kingdom to Yuyutsu. They travel through various countries, rivers, and mountains following the dharma of renunciation. Along the way, they encounter Agni who asks them to return Gandiva to Varuna. Arjuna eventually casts aside his bow into the water.

Yudhishthira's brothers fall down on the ground due to their own flaws: Droupadi for partiality towards Arjuna, Sahadeva for pride in being wise, Nakula for thinking he was unmatched in beauty, and Arjuna for disrespecting other bow wielders. Yudhishthira refuses to leave his brothers behind and is eventually praised by Dharma for his compassion and integrity. As a reward, Dharma makes Pandava ascend the chariot of the gods, which takes him to heaven.
