Summary of Anusashana parva. This is the summary of main parva, Anusashana parva.

**Summary**

The text describes various stories of brahmanas who are considered superior in their respective lineages. It tells the story of Kashyapa, a brahmana who controlled his body and entered the ground, bringing peace and dharma to the earth. The text also describes other brahmanas, including Utathya, Agastya, Vasishtha, Atri, Chyavana, and Durvasa, who are known for their great deeds and austerities.

The king asks Bhishma about the importance of worshipping brahmanas. Bhishma explains that brahmanas are superior beings who possess knowledge and energy, and that they should be treated with respect and honor. He tells Yudhishthira about his own experiences with Durvasa, a powerful brahmana.

The text also describes the importance of following dharma and the consequences of censuring it. Bhishma explains that those who follow dharma are virtuous and enjoy heaven, while those who hate dharma go to hell.

After this, the text shifts focus to Bhishma's death. He lies on a bed of arrows for 58 nights, waiting for the right time to die. When Yudhishthira arrives with his brothers and priests, Bhishma speaks to them, asking permission to die. He controls his breath and releases it upwards, and his soul ascends towards heaven.
