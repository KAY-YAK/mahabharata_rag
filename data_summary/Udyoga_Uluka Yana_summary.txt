Summary of Uluka Yana parva (under Udyoga parva)

**Summary**

Sanjaya told King Dhritarashtra about a conversation between Uluka (Duryodhana's messenger) and the Pandavas. Duryodhana sent Uluka to tell Yudhishthira that it was time for war, as promised earlier. Uluka spoke harsh words to Yudhishthira, reminding him of past injustices and urging him to fight. However, when Uluka spoke to Arjuna, he became enraged and boasted about his own strength.

Arjuna responded by saying that a true warrior relies on their own valour, not the valour of others. He vowed to kill Bhishma first in battle, as he was the eldest among the Kurus and had promised to kill the Pandavas. Arjuna told Uluka to tell Duryodhana that he would be killed by Bhimasena.

Uluka returned to Duryodhana and repeated the words of Arjuna and Keshava (Krishna). Duryodhana ordered his army to prepare for battle, and they were readied before sunrise.
