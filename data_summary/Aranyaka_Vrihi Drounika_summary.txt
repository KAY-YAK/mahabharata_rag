Summary of Vrihi Drounika parva (under Aranyaka parva)

**Summary**

The text is about Yudhishthira, one of the Pandavas, who lived in the forest with his brothers. They spent 11 years in difficulties, thinking that their misery was due to Yudhishthira's past deeds. The great sage Vyasa visited them and told them that true happiness comes from self-control, generosity, and following dharma (righteous living). He said that charity is more difficult than austerities but is superior. Vyasa then tells the story of Mudgala, who gave away rice to guests without expectation of reward, and was praised by the sage Durvasa. The messenger of the gods arrives and describes heaven as a place where people live in happiness, free from suffering and desire. However, he also mentions that there are taints associated with heaven, such as the fear of falling and regret after leaving it. Moudgalya (Mudgala) decides not to seek heaven but instead chooses the path of supreme salvation.
