Summary of Droupadi Harana parva (under Aranyaka parva)

**Summary**

Savitri, a beautiful princess, returns home after visiting many sacred places. Her father, Ashvapati, asks her about her journey and why she hasn't chosen a husband yet. Savitri tells him that she has chosen Satyavan, the son of Dyumatsena, who is known for his virtues but also has a short life expectancy. Narada, a wise man, confirms Savitri's choice and describes Satyavan's many good qualities. However, he also reveals that Satyavan will die within a year. Despite this, Savitri insists on marrying him, and her father agrees to the marriage after being convinced by Narada.

The wedding is arranged, and Savitri becomes the wife of Satyavan. She lives in the forest with her husband and his parents, performing austerities and satisfying everyone's needs. However, when Satyavan's death approaches, Savitri observes a vow of fasting and remains standing for three nights to prevent him from dying.

Yama, the god of death, arrives to take Satyavan away, but Savitri pleads with him to grant her boons instead. She asks for her father-in-law to regain his sight and kingdom, a hundred sons for her father, and a hundred sons for herself. Yama grants these boons and also gives Satyavan four hundred years of life.

Savitri returns to the forest and tells her husband about their encounter with Yama. Satyavan is initially confused but eventually remembers everything that happened. The couple returns to the hermitage, where they are greeted by the other residents.

The story ends with Dyumatsena regaining his sight and becoming king again. Savitri gives birth to a hundred sons, who are brave and extend their father's fame. She also has a hundred powerful brothers, who were begotten by Ashvapati on Malavi.
