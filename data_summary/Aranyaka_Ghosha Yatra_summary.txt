Summary of Ghosha Yatra parva (under Aranyaka parva)

**Summary**

Janamejaya asks Vaishampayana about the story of Duryodhana, who was exiled by his father Dhritarashtra after being defeated in a game of dice. Duryodhana's brothers and friends, including Karna and Shakuni, conspire to have him return to the forest where the Pandavas are living in exile.

Dhritarashtra is initially hesitant to allow Duryodhana to return, but eventually gives in to his son's demands. The Kouravas, led by Duryodhana, set out for the forest, accompanied by a large army and many women. However, they are met with resistance from the gandharvas, who are protecting the Pandavas.

A fierce battle ensues between the Kouravas and the gandharvas, but ultimately the gandharvas emerge victorious, capturing Duryodhana and his brothers. The Pandavas then arrive on the scene, and Yudhishthira orders them to free Duryodhana and his brothers.

Duryodhana is initially reluctant to accept their help, but eventually thanks the Pandavas for freeing him. He returns to Hastinapura, where he is met with a mixture of praise and criticism from his well-wishers and enemies.

Meanwhile, Karna vows to kill Arjuna in battle, and Dhritarashtra's sons begin to make preparations for a grand sacrifice, the rajasuya. However, the Pandavas are not pleased with this development, and Yudhishthira is particularly anxious about the prospect of facing Karna in battle.
