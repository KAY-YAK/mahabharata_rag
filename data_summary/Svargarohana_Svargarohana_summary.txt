Summary of Svargarohana parva (under Svargarohana parva)

**Summary**

The story begins with Janamejaya asking Vaishampayana about the fate of his great-grandfathers, Yudhishthira and others, who obtained heaven after their death. Vaishampayana tells him that they saw Duryodhana in heaven, but Yudhishthira was filled with intolerance towards him due to past grievances. Narada intervenes and explains that enmity is destroyed in heaven, and Yudhishthira should not speak ill of Duryodhana.

Yudhishthira then asks about his brothers who were killed in the battle, including Karna, Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula, Sahadeva, Dhrishtadyumna, and others. The gods reply that they will take him to see them, but first, he must face a test by going through a terrible place where his brothers are suffering. Yudhishthira is distressed by the stench and pain in this place, but then hears voices calling out to him, saying they are his brothers.

Yudhishthira realizes that these voices are actually the spirits of his brothers who have been sent to test him. He asks them why they are suffering, and they explain that it is due to their own karma. Yudhishthira then meets with Dharma, who explains that he has passed the third test by showing compassion towards his brothers.

Dharma tells Yudhishthira that he will now see his brothers in heaven, where they have obtained their respective stations. Yudhishthira sees Karna, Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula, Sahadeva, and others, all of whom are in a state of bliss. Dharma explains that each of them has obtained their own station based on their deeds.

The story then shifts to Janamejaya's snake sacrifice, where he is told about the fate of various characters from the Mahabharata. The brahmana sage Suta recounts the story of how different characters have obtained their stations in heaven or hell, including Bhishma, Drona, Dhritarashtra, and others.
