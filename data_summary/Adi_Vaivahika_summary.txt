Summary of Vaivahika parva (under Adi parva)

**Summary**

The king of Panchala, Drupada, invites the Pandavas and their mother Kunti to a wedding feast. The messenger tells them that they should come after finishing their daily rituals. When they arrive, they are treated with great respect by King Drupada and his family. The king is curious about the caste of the Pandavas and asks Yudhishthira if they are Kshatriyas or Brahmanas. Yudhishthira replies that they are Kshatriyas and sons of the great-souled Pandu.

King Drupada's son, Dhrishtadyumna, is also curious about the marriage arrangement between the Pandavas and his sister Krishna. He asks Vyasa, a wise Brahmana, for his opinion on the matter. Vyasa explains that in ancient times, the gods performed a great sacrifice and created a woman named Lakshmi to be the wife of five gods. The woman was born as Droupadi, and she is ordained to marry five husbands.

King Drupada is convinced by Vyasa's words and decides to follow the traditional rites for multiple husbands. He arranges for the marriage ceremony, which takes place with great pomp and ceremony. Yudhishthira marries Krishna first, followed by Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula, and Sahadeva.

After the marriage, King Drupada gives the Pandavas many gifts, including chariots, elephants, maidservants, and wealth. The Pandavas live in the city of Panchala with their new wife Krishna.
