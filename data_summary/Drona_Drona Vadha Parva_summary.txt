Drona is a great warrior who kills many warriors, including twenty thousand Panchalas. Rishis (sages) come to him and tell him that it's time for him to die, as he is performing cruel deeds in battle. Drona's son Ashvatthama has been killed by Bhima, but Drona doesn't believe this.

Dhrishtadyumna attacks Drona, who loses his senses due to grief. Sanjaya tells the king that Drona was no longer capable of fighting as he had done earlier. The two warriors fight fiercely, with Drona using iron javelins to kill Dhrishtadyumna's horses.

The battle continues with various warriors engaging in fierce battles. Bhima kills an elephant named Ashvatthama and tells Drona that it has been killed. Drona is overcome with grief and asks Yudhishthira if his son has indeed been killed. Yudhishthira tells a lie to save the situation.

Dhrishtadyumna attacks Drona, who is no longer capable of fighting as he had done earlier. The two warriors fight fiercely, with Drona using arrows to kill Dhrishtadyumna's horses and charioteer. Dhrishtadyumna then grasps a sword and descends on Drona.

In the end, Drona is killed by Dhrishtadyumna, and his head is severed from his body. The soldiers are distressed and run away in fear. Duryodhana's son tries to explain why the soldiers are running away, but he is unable to tell him the terrible news about his father.
