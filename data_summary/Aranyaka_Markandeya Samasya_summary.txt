Summary of Markandeya Samasya parva (under Aranyaka parva)

**Summary**

Markandeya tells a story about Saha Apa's family and their connection to fire. The lord of bhuh and bhuvah creates an excellent fire that is worshipped at sacrifices as garhapatya (or grihapati). This fire has many forms, including the Niyata or Kratu fire, which consumes dead bodies. Agni flees from the gods but is found by Atharva, who helps him regain his strength and becomes one with sweetness in his eyes.

Agni curses fish to be food for beings, and Atharva gives up his body to create different minerals and substances. He remains established in austerities until roused by other rishis. Markandeya then tells the story of Kartikeya (Skanda), who is born from Agni's semen after it was thrown into a golden well by Svaha, who had assumed the forms of the wives of the saptarshis.

Kartikeya grows up to be a powerful god with six heads and twelve arms. He is worshipped by the gods and becomes their general. Skanda marries Devasena, who is also known as Shashthi, Lakshmi, Asha, Sukhaprada, Sinivali, Kuhu, Sadvritti, and Aparajita.

The story then shifts to the origins of the grahas (evil spirits) that afflict children until they are sixteen years old. Skanda gives his mothers permission to devour the offspring of humans, but also creates a being called Skandapasmara, which is known as Shakuni, Putana, Shitaputana, and others.

The story concludes with Markandeya recounting the origins of the bells and pennants used by Kartikeya and Vishakha. The god Rudra (Shiva) then appears on Mount Shveta, surrounded by his army, and Skanda is instructed to protect the seventh corps of the Maruts.
