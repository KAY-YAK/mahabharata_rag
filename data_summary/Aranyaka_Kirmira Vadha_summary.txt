Summary of Kirmira Vadha parva (under Aranyaka parva)

**Summary**

Dhritarashtra asked Vidura to tell him about Bhima's encounter with a rakshasa named Kirmira. Vidura told the story of how the Pandavas entered the forest of Kamyaka at night, when man-eating rakshasas roam around. They saw Kirmira obstructing their path, and he was described as a terrifying creature with blazing eyes and hair. The Pandavas tried to calm him down, but Kirmira threatened to eat them up. Bhima then fought Kirmira, using a tree as a weapon, and the two engaged in a fierce battle that lasted only an instant. Eventually, Bhima killed Kirmira by pressing his throat with his knee.
