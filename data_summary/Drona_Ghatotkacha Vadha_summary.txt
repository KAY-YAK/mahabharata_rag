Summary of Ghatotkacha Vadha parva (under Drona parva)

**Summary**

The Kurus are delighted that Karna has arrived to fight, but they are concerned about their sons' chances of winning. Duryodhana summons Alayudha, a powerful rakshasa, to kill Ghatotkacha, Bhima's son. A fierce battle ensues between Alayudha and Ghatotkacha, but Bhima eventually kills Ghatotkacha's followers. Meanwhile, Karna attacks Bhima on a chariot, but Bhima counters with arrows. Krishna instructs Arjuna to follow Bhima and fight against Alayudha.

As the battle rages on, Ghatotkacha becomes angry and uses his maya to create a shower of weapons that devastates Duryodhana's army. The Kouravas are terrified, but Karna remains calm and uses his spear, given by Indra, to kill Ghatotkacha. With the rakshasa defeated, the Kouraveyas are delighted and honor Karna.
