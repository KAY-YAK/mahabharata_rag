Summary of Viduragamana parva (under Adi parva)

**Summary**

Vaishampayana narrates a conversation between King Dhritarashtra and his advisors about the Pandavas. The news has reached the kings that Droupadi has chosen the Pandavas as her husbands, and they are now allied with Drupada. This news causes great surprise among the rulers, who had earlier heard that Kunti and her sons were burnt alive in a house of lac.

Duryodhana is depressed by this news and returns to Hastinapura with his brothers, Ashvatthama, Shakuni, Karna, and Kripa. They blame Purochana for the failure and enter Hastinapura miserable and downcast.

Vidura learns about the Pandavas' good fortune and tells Dhritarashtra that they are prospering from good luck. However, Duryodhana and Karna suggest using various strategies to create conflict among the Pandavas or tempt Drupada to abandon them.

Bhishma advises against war with the Pandavas, suggesting instead a treaty and giving them half of the kingdom. Drona also recommends conciliation and presents to Drupada and the Pandavas.

However, Karna disagrees with Bhishma and Drona's advice, saying that the Pandavas cannot be overcome through trickery or vices. He suggests using arms to defeat them while they are still weak.

Dhritarashtra ultimately decides to follow Karna's advice and orders Vidura to bring the Pandavas back to Hastinapura with their wife, Droupadi.
