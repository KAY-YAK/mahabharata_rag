Summary of Bhagavat Yana parva (under Udyoga parva)

**Summary**

Vaishampayana narrates a story about Duryodhana's refusal to listen to Krishna's words of peace. Bhishma, Drona, and other wise men try to reason with him, but he is too consumed by his own desires and anger. His mother, Gandhari, also tries to persuade him to make peace, but he refuses to listen. Meanwhile, Krishna leaves the assembly hall and meets Kunti, who advises him on how to deal with Duryodhana. She tells him that a king's dharma is to protect his subjects and that he should not be afraid of death or defeat. She also reminds him of an ancient history about Vidula, who censured her son for being cowardly and advised him to display his manliness.

Kunti then advises Krishna on how to deal with Duryodhana, telling him to use conciliation, generosity, dissension, chastisement, and policy to achieve his goals. She also reminds him that a king's dharma is to protect his subjects and that he should not be afraid of death or defeat.

Krishna then leaves Kunti's house and meets with Bhishma and Drona, who try to persuade Duryodhana to make peace. However, he refuses to listen and instead plots with Shakuni and other advisors to capture Krishna. Meanwhile, Vidura tries to reason with Dhritarashtra, but he is too consumed by his own desires and anger.
