Summary of Mantra parva (under Sabha parva)

**Summary**

Vaishampayana tells a story about King Yudhishthira's desire to perform the rajasuya sacrifice. Yudhishthira is advised by his well-wishers and brothers to perform the sacrifice, but he is hesitant due to fear of Jarasandha, a powerful king who has conquered many kingdoms. Krishna, who is consulted by Yudhishthira, tells him that Jarasandha's power is great and that it would be difficult to defeat him without a strong plan. However, Krishna also says that if they can defeat Jarasandha, they will gain fame and become emperors.

Krishna then tells the story of how Jarasandha was born. He was the son of King Brihadratha, who had been childless for many years. A sage named Chandakoushika gave Brihadratha a mango that would grant him a son, but when the two queens ate the fruit, they gave birth to two half-bodies. A rakshasa woman named Jara united the two bodies and Jarasandha was born.

Krishna says that Jarasandha grew up to be a powerful king who conquered many kingdoms and became known for his bravery. However, Krishna also says that Jarasandha's power is not invincible and that he can be defeated with a strong plan.
