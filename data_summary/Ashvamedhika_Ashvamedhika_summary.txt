Summary of Ashvamedhika parva (under Ashvamedhika parva)

**Summary**

Vaishampayana tells a story about King Yudhishthira performing a great horse sacrifice. The king is advised by Vyasa to conduct the sacrifice with the help of knowledgeable officiating priests who follow the sacred texts. The sacrifice is performed successfully, and the king becomes energetic like Shakra. After the sacrifice, Yudhishthira gives away a large amount of gold to the brahmanas and divides the earth among them. He also gives away many kinds of jewels to the kings and other people.

A mongoose appears at the sacrifice and speaks in a human voice, criticizing the king's sacrifice. The mongoose tells the story of a brahmana who lived by the vow of unchha and donated only a trifle, but obtained heaven with his wife, son, and daughter-in-law. The mongoose says that this sacrifice is not equal to the one performed by the brahmana.

Vaishampayana explains that many kings have performed sacrifices and obtained fame in this world and gone to heaven. However, he also tells the story of Shakra's sacrifice, where the king of the gods was criticized by the maharshis for performing a sacrifice with slaughter of animals. The rishis told Shakra to perform the sacrifice with seeds that had been stored for three years, which would be great dharma.

The mongoose is revealed to be Krodha, who was cursed by the ancestors and became a mongoose after speaking ill of dharma. He censured Dharma's son Yudhishthira, but was freed from the curse when he spoke the truth.
