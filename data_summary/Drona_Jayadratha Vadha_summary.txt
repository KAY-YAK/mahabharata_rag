Summary of Jayadratha Vadha parva (under Drona parva)

**Summary**

Dhritarashtra is worried about his warriors being killed in battle by Arjuna (also known as Dhananjaya). He asks Sanjaya to describe how the battle raged. Sanjaya tells Dhritarashtra that Bhima, a warrior from the Shini lineage, followed Arjuna into battle and fought bravely. The two warriors clashed with other enemies, including Alambusa, who was killed by Satyaki (a member of the Madhava lineage). Sanjaya describes the fierce battle between Alambusa and Satyaki.

Later, Bhurishrava, a warrior from the Kuru lineage, engages in a fierce battle with Satyaki. The two warriors are evenly matched and exchange blows for a long time. Eventually, Arjuna intervenes and severs Bhurishrava's arm with an arrow. Bhurishrava is enraged but ultimately killed by Satyaki.

After Bhurishrava's death, the battle continues, and Arjuna faces off against Karna, a powerful warrior from the Suta lineage. The two engage in a fierce battle, exchanging blows and arrows. Eventually, Arjuna gains the upper hand and kills Karna's four horses and charioteer.

The battle then shifts to Jayadratha, the king of Sindhu, who is protected by his army and several powerful warriors. However, Arjuna uses divine weapons to kill Jayadratha and bring his head back to the battlefield. The head is then thrown down on the lap of Vriddhakshatra, Jayadratha's father, causing him to shatter into a hundred fragments.
