Summary of Apad Dharma parva (under Shanti parva)

**Summary**:

Goutama visits King Virupaksha's house and is honored as a brahmana. However, Goutama reveals that he was born in the central regions, lives with a shudra wife who has married again, and no longer observes brahmacharya or studies. The king invites one thousand learned brahmanas to eat at his house on the full moon in Kartika, where they receive excellent food and jewels as dakshina (gifts). Goutama takes some gold from the king's offerings but later regrets it due to hunger and thirst.

Rajadharma, a bird devoted to his friend, helps Goutama. However, Goutama kills Rajadharma for food and is then discovered by the king. The rakshasas are instructed to give Goutama to the bandits, who do not want to eat him either. Predatory creatures also refuse to devour Goutama.

Bhishma explains that there is no salvation for someone who is ungrateful or injures his friends. An ingrate is never respected and obtains a terrible hell. The importance of gratitude and affection towards friends is emphasized, as well as the need to avoid wicked people.
