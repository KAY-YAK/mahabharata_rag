Summary of Rajasuya parva (under Sabha parva)

**Summary**

The king Yudhishthira, who is known for his devotion to dharma, has become a universal emperor and wants to perform a great sacrifice called the rajasuya. He asks Krishna, who has arrived with a large army, for permission to perform the sacrifice. Krishna agrees and tells Yudhishthira that he can perform the sacrifice whenever he wants. Yudhishthira then prepares for the sacrifice by collecting all the necessary items and inviting many brahmanas and kings to attend.

The sacrifice is a grand affair with many dwelling houses, chariots, guards, soldiers, and wealth. The kings who attend the sacrifice bring many gifts, including jewels, and try to outdo each other in their generosity. Yudhishthira's sacrifice is said to be resplendent and rivals that of the god Varuna.
