Summary of Jatugriha Daha parva (under Adi parva)

**Summary**

The epic of the Mahabharata is being narrated by Vaishampayana to King Janamejaya. The story begins with Drona, a great warrior and teacher, asking King Dhritarashtra for permission to let his students, the sons of Pandu and Dhritarashtra, display their skills in arms. The king agrees, and Drona arranges a grand tournament where the princes showcase their valour and prowess.

The tournament is attended by many people, including Gandhari, Kunti, and other ladies of the royal household. Arjuna, also known as Phalguni or Partha, is introduced as the middle Pandava and the son of Indra. He exhibits his great dexterity in using various weapons and arrows.

Karna, a charioteer's son but born from Pritha when she was a virgin, enters the arena and claims to surpass Arjuna's feats. Duryodhana, the Kuru prince, is delighted with Karna's arrival and offers him his friendship and the kingdom of Anga. Karna accepts and is crowned king.

The story then shifts to how Drona asks his students to capture Drupada, the king of Panchala, as a fee for their learning. However, instead of killing Drupada, Drona forgives him and offers him half of his kingdom.

Duryodhana becomes jealous of the Pandavas' growing popularity and plots with Shakuni to kill them. However, Vidura advises the Pandavas not to reveal these plots.

The story then shifts to how Dhritarashtra sends the Pandavas to Varanavata under the pretext of attending a festival. Unbeknownst to them, Purochana has built an inflammable house for them to live in, with the intention of burning them alive.

However, Vidura's friend, a skilled digger, helps the Pandavas by building a tunnel under the ground where they can escape if needed. The Pandavas pretend to be trusting and contented while living in the house, but secretly plan their escape.

When Purochana sets fire to the armoury, the Pandavas emerge through the tunnel and flee quickly, unobserved. They are aided by Bhima's strength and speed as he carries his mother and brothers on his back.

The story concludes with the Pandavas reaching a deep forest where they rest under a fig tree. Bhima stays awake to keep watch while his family sleeps.
