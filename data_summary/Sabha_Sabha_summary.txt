Summary of Sabha parva (under Sabha parva)

**Summary**

Vaishampayana is narrating a story about King Yudhishthira and his brothers. Maya, an asura, joins their hands in respect and worships them before asking what he can do for Arjuna. Arjuna tells him to leave peacefully but Maya wants to build something for the Pandavas. Krishna suggests that Maya should build a wonderful assembly hall for Dharmaraja. Maya agrees and starts building it with the help of his servant rakshasas.

The assembly hall is completed in 14 months, and it's described as being beautiful, divine, and encrusted with jewels. It has golden pillars and a circumference of ten thousand kishku. The hall is filled with various objects, including a matchless tank full of lotuses, giant trees that are always flowering, and ponds adorned with swans, ducks, and geese.

After the assembly hall is completed, Maya informs King Dharmaraja, who enters it and feeds ten thousand brahmanas with ghee, payasa, roots, fruits, and other offerings. The Pandavas then pleasure in that beautiful sabha, like Shakra does in heaven.

The story takes a turn when Narada, a sage, arrives at the assembly hall accompanied by other rishis. He asks Yudhishthira questions about his wealth, mind, and actions, testing him to see if he is following dharma, artha, and kama.

Yudhishthira answers all of Narada's questions correctly, and Narada praises him for being a just king. However, when asked about the sabhas of other gods, Narada describes them in detail, including Shakra's sabha, Yama's sabha, Varuna's sabha, and Kubera's sabha.

Narada also tells Yudhishthira that he has seen Brahma's sabha, which is a celestial, immeasurable, indescribable, and disembodied sabha. He describes it as being filled with every form of energy, divine, served by masses of brahmarshis, radiant with Brahma's riches, extremely beautiful, and the dispeller of fatigue.
