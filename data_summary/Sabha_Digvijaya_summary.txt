Summary of Digvijaya parva (under Sabha parva)

**Summary**

Vaishampayana narrates the conquests of the Pandavas in various directions after they obtained the supreme bow from Partha (Arjuna). Arjuna sets out with a large army to conquer the region protected by Dhanada (Kubera), the lord of wealth. He is joined by his brothers Bhima and the twins, who also set out with their armies. The Pandavas conquer various regions, including the land of Kuninda, Shakala, Pragjyotisha, and others. Arjuna's conquests take him to the northern regions, where he meets Brihanta, a mighty king who is eventually defeated by Arjuna.

Bhima sets out in an eastern direction with a great circle of forces and conquers various kingdoms, including Panchala, Gandakis, Videhas, and others. He also defeats King Sudharma of Dasharna in an unarmed wrestling match. Bhima then marches towards the south and conquers Sukumara and Sumitra, the lord of men.

Sahadeva sets out in a southern direction with a large army and conquers various kingdoms, including the land of Shurasenas, Matsya, Dantavakra, and others. He also defeats King Jambaka's son, Bhoja, who had earlier been defeated by Vasudeva. Sahadeva then sends envoys to King Rukmin Bhishmaka of Bhojakata and his sons, who happily accept the suzerainty.

Nakula sets out in a western direction with a large army and conquers various kingdoms, including Rohitaka, Sairishaka, Maheccha, and others. He also defeats the clans known as Utsavasamketa who dwelt in the forests of Pushkara.
