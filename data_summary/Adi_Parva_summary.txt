**Summary**

The Mahabharata is an ancient Indian epic that tells the story of the Pandavas, five brothers who are on a journey to attend Drupada's daughter Droupadi's svayamvara. The story begins with Arjuna asking a gandharva about King Kalmashapada's actions and how he was cursed by Shakti, Vashishtha's son. The king was forced to die instantly when he next united with his wife during her season.

The Pandavas meet various characters along the way, including a gandharva who suggests they appoint Dhoumya as their priest. They then proceed to Utkochaka tirtha and instate Dhoumya as their priest. The story concludes with the Pandavas returning home, where they are welcomed back by their mother Kunti.

The text also describes the events following Arjuna's abduction of Subhadra, Krishna's sister. Vasudeva advises that Arjuna return and marry Subhadra to avoid dishonor to their lineage. Arjuna returns and marries Subhadra, but Droupadi is jealous and tries to persuade him to leave her for Subhadra.

The story also tells about the burning of Khandava forest by Agni, the fire god, with the help of Arjuna and Krishna. The forest was protected by Indra, but Agni's flames were so powerful that they could not be extinguished by Indra's rain. Many beings lived in the forest, including serpents, birds, and animals, which were all consumed by the fire.
