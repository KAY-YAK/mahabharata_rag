Summary of Kundala Aharana parva (under Aranyaka parva)

**Summary**

The story revolves around Karna, a prince who is devoted to his father, Surya (the sun god). Surya advises Karna not to give away his divine earrings and armor, which are essential for his protection in battle. However, Karna decides to give them to Indra, the king of the gods, in exchange for an invincible spear called shakti. The story also tells the tale of how Karna was born to Kunti, a princess who had invoked Surya using a mantra given by Durvasa, a powerful brahmana.

Karna's birth is a result of Kunti's desire to have a son with divine qualities, and she gives him up in a basket on the river Ashva. The basket is carried away by the river and eventually reaches Radha, Adhiratha's wife, who adopts Karna as her own son. Karna grows up to become a great warrior and eventually meets Indra, who disguises himself as a brahmana and asks for Karna's earrings and armor.
