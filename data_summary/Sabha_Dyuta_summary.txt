Summary of Dyuta parva (under Sabha parva)

**Summary**

The story revolves around Yudhishthira, one of the Pandava brothers, who is playing a game of dice against Shakuni, an ally of their enemies. Despite having many riches to stake, Yudhishthira continues to offer his family members and queen Droupadi as stakes in the game. The elders in the assembly hall are shocked and ashamed by Yudhishthira's decision.

As the game progresses, Shakuni resorts to deceit and tells Yudhishthira that he has won each time. Eventually, Yudhishthira offers his beloved queen Droupadi as a stake, which is met with outrage from the assembly hall. Duhshasana, one of Duryodhana's brothers, forcibly drags Droupadi into the sabha, despite her being in her menses and clad only in a single garment.

The Pandavas are enraged by this act, but Yudhishthira remains silent, as if he has lost his senses. Bhima is particularly angry and threatens to kill Duhshasana, while Arjuna tries to pacify him. The assembly hall is filled with tension and outrage, with some of the kings calling for Droupadi's release.

In a surprising turn of events, Dhritarashtra, Yudhishthira's father-in-law, intervenes and offers Droupadi two boons: that her husbands will not be slaves and that she will not have to refer to Yudhishthira as the son of a slave. Droupadi declines the third boon, saying that she is disinclined towards avarice.

The story concludes with Dhritarashtra advising Yudhishthira to rule his kingdom wisely and peacefully, and to avoid indulging in hostilities. Yudhishthira and his brothers leave for Indraprastha, accompanied by Droupadi, who is still in her menses.
