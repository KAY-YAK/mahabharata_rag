Summary of Mousala parva (under Mousala parva)

**Summary**

The text describes the destruction of the Yadavas, a clan led by Krishna, due to a curse imposed by brahmanas. The story begins with Yudhishthira noticing ominous signs and portents, which are later revealed to be connected to the impending doom of the Vrishnis. After 36 years have passed, the Vrishnis are destroyed in a great carnage, where they kill each other with clubs. Krishna's cousin Uddhava is the first to leave Dvaraka, followed by Krishna and his brother Rama, who go into the forest to practice yoga.

Meanwhile, Arjuna, Krishna's friend and ally, arrives at Dvaraka after being informed of the destruction of the Yadavas. He finds the city in a state of chaos and despair, with women and children crying out for help. Vasudeva, Krishna's father, is overcome with grief and decides to leave his body, which is then cremated by Arjuna.

Arjuna then sets out to protect the remaining Vrishni women and their families, but they are attacked by bandits who seek to steal their wealth. Despite his efforts, Arjuna is unable to defend them, and many of the women are abducted or killed. Eventually, he retreats and leaves the remaining women in Shakraprastha, where they are protected by Vajra, Krishna's grandson.

The text concludes with Arjuna visiting Vyasa, a sage who is also his maternal uncle, and seeking guidance on how to cope with the loss of Krishna and the destruction of the Yadavas. Vyasa advises Arjuna that it was destiny that led to the downfall of the Vrishnis and that he should not grieve for what cannot be changed.
