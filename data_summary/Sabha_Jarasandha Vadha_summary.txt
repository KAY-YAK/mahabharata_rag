Summary of Jarasandha Vadha parva (under Sabha parva)

**Summary**

Vasudeva (Krishna) tells Yudhishthira that it's time to kill Jarasandha, a powerful king who has been oppressing other kings. Vasudeva believes that Bhima, Arjuna, and himself can defeat Jarasandha in battle. They disguise themselves as brahmanas (priests) and enter Magadha city, where they meet King Jarasandha. Jarasandha is suspicious of their intentions but welcomes them as guests.

Krishna explains to Jarasandha that kshatriyas (warriors) have the right to wear flowers and fragrant paste, even if it's not traditional for brahmanas. He also tells Jarasandha that they will not accept his homage because they are there to accomplish a task. Jarasandha refuses to free the captive kings and instead challenges Bhima to a duel.

The duel between Bhima and Jarasandha is intense, with both warriors using their strength to try and defeat each other. However, Krishna advises Bhima to hold back and not press down on Jarasandha when he's weakened. Bhima then seizes Jarasandha and breaks his back into two.

Krishna then mounts a divine chariot, which is yoked with divine horses and has a flagstaff that's visible from a distance of one yojana (a unit of measurement). Garuda, the eagle, sits on the flagstaff, and many other blazing beings join them. Krishna leaves Magadha city with Bhima and Arjuna, who are riding in the chariot.

The kings who were imprisoned by Jarasandha come out to show homage to Krishna and thank him for their freedom. Krishna tells them that Yudhishthira wants to perform a rajasuya (a sacrifice) and asks for their help. The kings agree to aid Yudhishthira, and Krishna accepts their gifts.

Krishna then instates Jarasandha's son as the new king of Magadha and leaves with Bhima and Arjuna. They go to Indraprastha, where they meet Yudhishthira and celebrate their victory over Jarasandha.
