Summary of Udyoga parva (under Udyoga parva)

**Summary**

The text describes a conversation between Shalya and Indra (the king of the gods) about how Nahusha, a wicked king, was dislodged from heaven. Agastya, an illustrious ascetic, explains to Indra that Nahusha argued with sages about mantras related to cow sprinkling rituals, which led to his downfall. As a result of touching Agastya's head with his foot, Nahusha lost his energy and prosperity, and he was eventually dislodged from heaven.

Shalya then reports the satisfaction of various groups (gods, ancestors, yakshas, etc.) at Nahusha's downfall. Indra is praised by the masses of gandharvas and apsaras, and he ascends Airavata, the king of elephants. The text also describes the arrival of various armies to fight on behalf of the Pandavas and the Kouravas.
