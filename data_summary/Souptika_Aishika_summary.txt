Summary of Aishika parva (under Souptika parva)

**Summary**

Vaishampayana narrates the story of Yudhishthira, the king of the Pandavas, who is overcome with sorrow after learning about the death of his sons and brothers in a battle. Dhrishtadyumna's charioteer informs Dharmaraja that Ashvatthama, the son of Drona, had killed thousands of men, elephants, and horses while they were asleep. Yudhishthira is grief-stricken and falls down senseless. Satyaki and Bhimasena try to comfort him.

Yudhishthira reflects on the nature of victory and defeat, stating that even those who are victorious can be defeated by adversity. He laments the death of his sons and brothers, comparing it to a forest being cut down with a battleaxe. Krishna (Droupadi) is brought to Yudhishthira, and she is overcome with grief upon learning about the death of her sons.

Krishna urges Bhimasena to kill Ashvatthama, who had obtained the brahmashira weapon from Drona. Bhimasena sets out on his chariot to find Ashvatthama, accompanied by Arjuna and Yudhishthira. They eventually meet Ashvatthama near Vyasa, who is seated with rishis.

Ashvatthama releases a divine weapon, the brahmashira, which threatens to destroy the Pandavas. However, Narada and Vedavyasa intervene, pacifying the energies of the two weapons. Arjuna withdraws his divine arrow, and Ashvatthama is unable to retract his own weapon.

Vyasa advises Ashvatthama to release the brahmashira towards the wombs of the Pandava women, which he does. Krishna reassures Yudhishthira that Parikshit, a future king, will be born from Uttara's womb and will protect the earth for sixty years.

Ashvatthama gives the gem to the Pandavas and leaves for the forest. The Pandavas return to their camp with Dasharha, where they find Droupadi afflicted by grief. Bhimasena consoles her, giving her the celestial gem and urging her to remember the dharma of kshatriyas.
