Summary of Subhadra-harana parva (under Adi parva)

**Summary**

The great festival of the Vrishnis and the Andhakas is being held on Mount Raivataka. Many warriors give away gifts to brahmanas during the festival. The region around the mountain is decorated with palaces, lamps, and music. Arjuna and Krishna attend the festival, where they see Subhadra, Vasudeva's daughter. Arjuna becomes captivated by her beauty and asks Krishna for advice on how to marry her. Krishna suggests that Arjuna abduct Subhadra in a svayamvara ceremony or through abduction, as it is permissible for kshatriyas. Arjuna decides to abduct Subhadra with Krishna's help.

Arjuna sends messengers to inform Yudhishthira about his plan, and after getting permission from Vasudeva and Yudhishthira, he mounts a golden chariot and sets out to abduct Subhadra. He forces her onto the chariot, and they set off towards Dvaraka. The armed soldiers with Subhadra raise an alarm, and the news reaches the assembly hall in Dvaraka.

The Vrishnis and Andhakas gather at the assembly hall, and when they hear about Arjuna's conduct, they become intolerant of him and prepare for war. However, Baladeva, who is intoxicated with wine, calms them down and suggests that they wait for Krishna to speak his mind.
