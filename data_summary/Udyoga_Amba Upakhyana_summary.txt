Summary of Amba Upakhyana parva (under Udyoga parva)

**Summary**

Bhishma told his son that a woman had decided to perform austerities to kill him in battle as revenge for being left without a husband. The god Shiva appeared, satisfied her with a boon, and promised she would defeat Bhishma in another life. She gathered wood, built a funeral pyre, and set it on fire, saying it was for Bhishma's destruction.

The woman, later known as Shikhandi, was born to King Drupada of Panchala as a daughter but was raised as a son due to a boon from Shiva. She married the daughter of Hiranyavarma, a powerful king, and when her true nature was discovered, Hiranyavarma was enraged.

Shikhandi then approached Sthunakarna, a yaksha who granted boons, and asked for his help in becoming a man to save her father and herself from Hiranyavarma's wrath. The yaksha agreed but cursed Shikhandi to become a woman again after she had fulfilled her purpose.

Shikhandi became a man and entered the city, where he met his father and told him everything that had happened. Drupada sent a message to Hiranyavarma, saying that Shikhandi was indeed a man, and the two kings eventually made peace.

The story of Shikhandi's transformation is then used as an example by Bhishma to explain why he will not kill her in battle.
