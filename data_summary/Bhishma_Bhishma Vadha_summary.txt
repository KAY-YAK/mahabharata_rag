Summary of Bhishma Vadha parva (under Bhishma parva)

**Summary**

Dhritarashtra asks Sanjaya to describe the great battle fought by Bhishma against the Pandavas on the tenth day. Sanjaya tells him about how Bhishma, using his supreme weapons, killed many warriors and created destruction among the army of the Pandavas. The two armies clashed, and a terrible sound arose as they advanced against each other. Bhishma, with dharma in his soul, desired a quick death and stationed himself at the forefront of the battle. Sanjaya describes how various characters fought on both sides, including Arjuna, Duryodhana, Drona's son, and others. The battle rages on for days, with both armies suffering heavy losses. Bhishma continues to fight valiantly, killing many warriors and becoming a thorn in the side of the Pandavas.

Eventually, Bhishma is severely wounded by Arjuna's arrows and falls from his chariot. Despite being covered in arrows, he retains his life and decides to wait until uttarayana (the northern course of the sun) before giving up his life. The swans sent by Ganga try to persuade him to leave during dakshinayana (the southern course of the sun), but Bhishma refuses.

The Pandavas and Srinjayas are overjoyed at Bhishma's downfall, while the Kurus are devastated. Duryodhana is particularly grief-stricken and tries to comfort his father. Sanjaya describes how the kings from both sides approach Bhishma and pay their respects to him.

Bhishma requests a pillow to support his head, which Arjuna provides by shooting three arrows into the ground. Bhishma then asks for water, which Arjuna provides using his parjanya weapon. The Kurus are amazed at Arjuna's feat, and Bhishma praises him as a great archer.

Bhishma then speaks to Duryodhana, urging him to make peace with the Pandavas and abandon his anger. He reminds Duryodhana of Arjuna's incredible abilities and warns him that he will be destroyed if he continues to fight against the Pandavas.
