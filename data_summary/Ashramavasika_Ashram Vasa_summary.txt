Summary of Ashram Vasa parva (under Ashramavasika parva)

**Summary**

Vaishampayana tells a story about great sages coming to visit King Dhritarashtra, who is living in exile after the war. Kunti, the king's wife, serves them according to prescribed rites and they engage in conversations about dharma (righteousness). Narada, one of the sages, shares stories of kings who achieved success through their austerities and tells Dhritarashtra that he will also achieve great success if he stays at the hermitage. The king is delighted by Narada's words.

Later, Yudhishthira, the eldest son of Pandu, decides to visit his father in the forest. He gathers his brothers, wives, and a large entourage and sets out for Kurukshetra. When they arrive, they meet Dhritarashtra and are welcomed by him. The king asks about their welfare and is pleased to see them.

Vidura, who has been living in the forest as an ascetic, is summoned by Yudhishthira but refuses to come out of his solitude. Yudhishthira follows Vidura into the forest and eventually meets him. However, instead of speaking to him, Vidura uses yoga to enter Yudhishthira's body and ignite his energy.

The night is spent in the hermitage, with the Pandavas sleeping on the ground near their mother. The next day, Vyasa, a great sage, arrives at the hermitage and invites Dhritarashtra to speak about his welfare. Dhritarashtra asks about his family's well-being and Vyasa responds by explaining the nature of Dharma (righteousness) and its relationship to Vidura.
