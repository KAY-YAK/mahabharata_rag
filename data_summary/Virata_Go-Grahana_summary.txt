Summary of Go-Grahana parva (under Virata parva)

**Summary**

Kripa advises Karna not to fight Arjuna alone due to his many skills and accomplishments. Instead, he suggests that all six charioteers unite together to fight Arjuna. Ashvatthama criticizes Karna for boasting about his past victories without actually performing any great deeds. Bhishma agrees with Ashvatthama's words and advises the Kouravas to prepare for battle. Drona calculates the time and decides that it is now or never for the Pandavas to fight.

The Kurus arrange themselves in battle formations, but Arjuna swiftly advances towards them, his chariot uttering a roar. The two armies clash, with Arjuna defeating many warriors, including Kripa, Drona's son Ashvatthama, and Karna. Bhishma then engages Arjuna in a fierce duel, but ultimately retreats after being wounded.

Duryodhana attempts to attack Arjuna, but is pierced by an arrow shot by Partha. The elephant that Vikarna was riding is also killed by Arjuna's arrow. Duryodhana and his army flee the battlefield, while Bhishma returns to protect them from Arjuna. However, after being wounded by Bhishma's arrows, Duryodhana retreats.

Partha then uses a divine weapon called sammohana to make all the Kuru warriors fall unconscious. Virata's son is tasked with gathering their garments and returning to Arjuna. After the Kurus regain consciousness, they decide to leave the battlefield and return to their kingdom.
