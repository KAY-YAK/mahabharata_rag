Summary of Anudyuta parva (under Sabha parva)

**Summary**

Janamejaya asked Vaishampayana about the state of mind of Dhritarashtra's sons when they learned that the Pandavas had been granted permission to leave with their riches. Vaishampayana replied that Duhshasana went to his brother Duryodhana and told him that their father, Dhritarashtra, had made a mistake by giving the Pandavas what was rightfully theirs. Duryodhana and his advisors plotted against the Pandavas and convinced Dhritarashtra to let them gamble again with the dice.

The Pandavas were summoned back to the sabha and were challenged to play another game of dice. Yudhishthira, despite knowing that it would lead to ruin, agreed to play again. The game was rigged by Shakuni, and the Pandavas lost. They were forced to leave their kingdom and go into exile in the forest.

The Pandavas prepared for their journey, dressing themselves in deerskins and upper garments. Duhshasana mocked them, saying that they would be like sesame seeds without kernels or deer with only skin on them. Bhima suppressed his anger and vowed to kill Duryodhana and his followers in battle.

As the Pandavas left the sabha, Arjuna swore to kill Karna and his followers in battle. Sahadeva vowed to overpower Shakuni and kill him in battle. Nakula said that he would relieve the earth of the sons of Dhritarashtra.

Yudhishthira bid farewell to all the descendants of the Bharata lineage, including Bhishma, Somadatta, and Drona. Vidura spoke words of wisdom to Yudhishthira, advising him to follow dharma and artha in all his deeds.

Kunti was extremely miserable on seeing that her sons were about to leave for the forest. She comforted them and showed them homage before they set out. As they left, great lamentations were heard from the inner quarters of the Pandavas.

Vidura described the departure of the Pandavas to Dhritarashtra, saying that they were going in different forms, indicating their resolutions through signs and marks on their bodies. Narada appeared in the sabha and spoke terrible words, saying that the Kouravas would be destroyed in the fourteenth year due to Duryodhana's crime.

Drona advised Dhritarashtra to offer respect to the Pandavas and let them go with arms, chariots, and infantry. However, this did not materialize.
