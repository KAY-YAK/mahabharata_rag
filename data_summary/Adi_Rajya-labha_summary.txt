Summary of Rajya-labha parva (under Adi parva)

**Summary**

King Drupada and Vidura discuss whether the Pandavas should return home after their alliance. Drupada decides to follow the advice of Krishna, who thinks it's a good time for them to go back. The Pandavas, led by Yudhishthira, thank King Drupada and set out towards Hastinapura with their family members. They are welcomed by Dhritarashtra and his son Bhishma, but instead of staying in the city, they are asked to go to Khandavaprastha, a forest, where they can be protected by Partha (Arjuna) and take half the kingdom.

The Pandavas accept this offer and with Krishna's leadership, they transform Khandavaprastha into a beautiful city called Indraprastha. The city is well-protected, has many gardens, trees, ponds, and tanks, and becomes a desirable place for merchants, artisans, and Brahmanas.
