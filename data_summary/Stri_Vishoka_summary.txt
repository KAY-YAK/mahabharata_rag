Summary of Vishoka parva (under Stri parva)

**Summary**

Janamejaya asks Vaishampayana to tell him about the events that occurred after the death of Duryodhana and his soldiers. Vaishampayana tells Janamejaya that Dhritarashtra was overcome with grief and sorrow upon hearing the news, but Sanjaya tried to console him by telling him that sorrowing does not help and that it is necessary to perform funeral rites for those who have died. Dhritarashtra then laments about his sons and grandsons being killed and how he will now live without them.

Vidura tries to console Dhritarashtra by telling him that death is the end of life, but it also leads to a higher state. He explains that beings come into existence and cease to be due to their own deeds and that one should not sorrow over something that affects the entire country and not a single person alone. Vidura then tells Dhritarashtra about the path of intelligence, which is like a journey through an impenetrable forest filled with dangers.

Dhritarashtra asks Vidura to explain further and Vidura uses a metaphor to describe the cycle of life as a forest where beings are afflicted by diseases, old age, and other difficulties. He tells Dhritarashtra that one who is learned can escape from this cycle by controlling their senses and desires.

Krishna Dvaipayana (Vedavyasa) then speaks to Dhritarashtra and tells him that he should not sorrow over the death of his sons because it was destined to happen. He explains that Duryodhana was born to accomplish a task, which was to destroy the Kurus, and that even if one tries for a long time, no being can deviate from a path that destiny has laid down.
