Summary of Tirtha yatra parva (under Aranyaka parva)

**Summary**

Vaishampayana tells a story about Bhima, one of the Pandavas, who is sent by Panchali to fetch more sougandhika flowers from Gandhamadana mountain. Bhima encounters various animals on his journey and kills them with his strength. He meets Hanuman, a giant monkey, who is asleep and has been restrained by the gods. Hanuman tells Bhima about the yugas (eras) of time and how dharma decays in each era. Bhima asks to see Hanuman's earlier form, and Hanuman shows him his gigantic shape when he leapt over the ocean. Bhima is amazed and requests Hanuman to decrease his size. Hanuman then gives advice on dharma and tells Bhima about the importance of following one's own dharma and not deviating from it. After their conversation, Hanuman disappears, and Bhima continues his journey to fetch sougandhika flowers.
