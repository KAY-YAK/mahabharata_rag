Summary of Chaitraratha parva (under Adi parva)

**Summary**

The story begins with Arjuna asking a gandharva about King Kalmashapada's actions. The gandharva explains how the king was cursed by Shakti, Vashishtha's son, and under its influence, he went to a deserted forest with his wife. There, they saw a Brahmana and brahmani who were about to engage in an act of intimacy but ran away when the king approached. The king forcibly took the Brahmana, causing his wife's tears to become a blazing fire that killed everything around them. Enraged, the brahmani cursed the king to die instantly when he next united with his wife during her season.

The gandharva continues by explaining that Vashishtha knew about the curse through his austerities and powers of knowledge. Later, the king was freed from the curse but still had no recollection of it. When his wife repulsed him due to the impending doom, he remembered the curse and became alarmed.
