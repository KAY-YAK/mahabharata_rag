Summary of Shanti parva. This is the summary of main parva, Shanti parva.

**Summary**

The text discusses various aspects of dharma, including rajadharma, which is the duty of kings. Bhishma explains to Yudhishthira that a king should be able to adapt to different situations and protect his kingdom using his intelligence. A king's prosperity depends on balancing dharma, artha (wealth), and kama (pleasure). Bhishma also advises Yudhishthira to use his intelligence to follow the ordinances of dharma.

The text then shifts to Goutama, who visits King Virupaksha's house but is later discovered to be an ingrate. Bhishma explains that there is no salvation for someone who is ungrateful or injures their friends. The importance of gratitude and affection towards friends is emphasized.

Finally, the text discusses the dharma that leads to Narayana, a supreme god. Vaishampayana explains that this dharma is difficult to comprehend and practice but those who follow it are emancipated. Bhishma tells Janamejaya a story about a brahmana who seeks advice from Padmanabha, a serpent, on how to accumulate merit.
