Summary of Hrada Pravesha parva (under Shalya parva)

**Summary**

The battle between the Pandavas and Shakuni's followers continues. Sahadeva fights against Shakuni, who attacks him with various weapons but is eventually killed by a razor-sharp arrow shot by Sahadeva. Meanwhile, Bhima kills Uluka in battle. The Pandavas counter-attack Shakuni's followers, who are enraged and ready to give up their lives. However, they are defeated by the Pandavas, led by Arjuna and Bhimasena.

As the battle rages on, Duryodhana sees that his army is being destroyed and decides to retreat. He enters a lake with a club in hand, but later emerges and tells Sanjaya to inform Dhritarashtra about his defeat and death. The remaining Kourava soldiers are killed by the Pandavas, except for three rathas: Ashvatthama, Kripa, and Kritavarma.

Sanjaya is released alive by Dhrishtadyumna and returns to Hastinapura, where he finds Yuyutsu, who has entered the city with the king's wives. Vidura praises Yuyutsu for taking the right decision in entering the city to protect the people.
