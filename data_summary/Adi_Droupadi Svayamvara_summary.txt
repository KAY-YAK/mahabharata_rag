Summary of Droupadi Svayamvara parva (under Adi parva)

**Summary**

The story revolves around the Pandavas, five brothers who are on a journey to attend Drupada's daughter Droupadi's svayamvara. The Pandavas meet various characters along the way, including a gandharva who suggests they appoint Dhoumya as their priest. They then proceed to Utkochaka tirtha and instate Dhoumya as their priest.

The Pandavas witness the preparations for Drupada's daughter's svayamvara, where many kings and princes have gathered to compete for her hand in marriage. The competition is fierce, with each king boasting of his strength and valour. However, none can string the bow that has been set up as a challenge.

Arjuna, one of the Pandavas, steps forward and strings the bow, shooting down the target with ease. This impresses Drupada and earns Arjuna the right to marry Droupadi. However, this decision is met with anger from the other kings, who feel that Arjuna has insulted them by passing over their own sons.

The situation escalates into a confrontation between the Pandavas and the other kings, but ultimately, it is resolved peacefully when Krishna intervenes and suggests that Droupadi be married to all five brothers. The story concludes with the Pandavas returning home, where they are welcomed back by their mother Kunti.
