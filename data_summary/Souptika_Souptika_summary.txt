Summary of Souptika parva (under Souptika parva)

**Summary**

The Mahabharata continues with Sanjaya describing to Dhritarashtra the events that occurred after Duryodhana's death. Ashvatthama, Kripa, and Kritavarma had fled the battlefield but were overcome by grief and sorrow. They decided to take revenge on the Pandavas while they slept in their camp. However, when they reached the camp, they encountered a powerful being who was guarding the gate. The being devoured all of Ashvatthama's arrows and javelins, forcing him to retreat.

Ashvatthama then sought refuge with Shiva, offering himself as a sacrifice to the god. A golden altar appeared before him, and he entered the blazing fire, presenting himself as an oblation. However, Shiva smiled and said that Ashvatthama had been tested to show honor to Krishna. He then entered Ashvatthama's body and gave him a powerful sword.

Ashvatthama descended from his chariot and approached Dhrishtadyumna's abode, where he killed the Panchala king while he was sleeping. The other warriors in the camp were awakened by the noise, but they were no match for Ashvatthama. He uprooted all of them with his divine weapon and continued to slaughter the Pandavas and their allies.

The night became a scene of chaos and destruction, with men, elephants, and horses killing each other. The rakshasas and pishachas fed on the flesh of men and drank blood. Ashvatthama emerged from the camp, his body covered in human blood, and rejoined Kripa and Kritavarma.

The three warriors then went to where Duryodhana lay dying, surrounded by carnivorous beasts. They wept for him and wiped the blood from his face with their hands. Kripa praised Duryodhana's bravery and said that he had been brought down by time. Ashvatthama spoke of his own grief and how he would roam the earth in sorrow.

Dhritarashtra was informed of the events, and he let out long and warm sighs, becoming immersed in deep thoughts.
