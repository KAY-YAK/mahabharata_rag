Summary of Prajagara parva (under Udyoga parva)

**Summary**

Dhritarashtra, the king, listens to Vidura's words of wisdom. Vidura advises Dhritarashtra to avoid those who are superior in riches but lack qualities. He emphasizes the importance of protecting relatives, especially the Pandavas, and warns against associating with wicked people. Vidura stresses the need for humility, valour, forgiveness, and good conduct to achieve prosperity and eternal fame.

Vidura explains that one should not do to others what is injurious to oneself and that anger should be conquered with lack of anger. He also advises Dhritarashtra to sorrow over a man who is without learning, a couple that has no offspring, subjects who are hungry, and a kingdom that has no king.

Vidura tells Dhritarashtra about the importance of dharma (righteous living) and the need to follow good conduct towards relatives. He advises Dhritarashtra to protect his penis and stomach with steadfastness and to avoid those who are evil in intelligence and have no wisdom.

Dhritarashtra asks Vidura if there is anything he has not spoken about, and Vidura mentions an ancient and eternal youth named Sanatsujata, who will speak to Dhritarashtra about matters that are overt and covert. However, Vidura cannot reveal more because of his shudra birth.
