Summary of Yaksha yuddha parva (under Aranyaka parva)

**Summary**

Arjuna was a skilled warrior and gained Indra's confidence. He was given ten weapons and five magical ones by Indra to destroy 30 million danavas living on the shores of the ocean. Arjuna set out with his divine chariot, driven by Matali, to kill the nivatakavachas. The gods assembled and gave him their blessings before he left.

Arjuna then described his battle with the nivatakavachas, where they used various types of maya (delusion) against him. He countered their attacks with his own maya and eventually killed them all. After that, Arjuna went to Hiranyapura, a city inhabited by Poulamas and Kalakeyas who were protected by a boon from Brahma.

Arjuna attacked the city with his divine chariot and arrows, but the danavas used their maya to make it difficult for him. He then invoked the roudra (Shiva) weapon, which took many forms and destroyed the danavas. Arjuna also killed the nivatakavachas who had entered the interiors of the earth.

After destroying Hiranyapura, Arjuna returned to Indra's abode with Matali, where he was congratulated by the gods for his deeds. Arjuna spent five years in Indra's abode before returning to his brothers on Mount Gandhamadana.
