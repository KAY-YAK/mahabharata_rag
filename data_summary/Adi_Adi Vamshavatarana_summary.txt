Summary of Adi Vamshavatarana parva (under Adi parva)

**Summary**

The text describes the story of the Mahabharata, an ancient Indian epic. It begins with the birth of Krishna Dvaipayana, also known as Vyasa, who is said to have divided the one Veda into four parts and was a brahmarshi, knower of everything, wise poet, truthful, and pure. The text then describes how Vyasa went to the sacrificial assembly of King Janamejaya and was worshipped by him.

Janamejaya asked Vyasa to narrate the story of the Kurus and the Pandavas, which led to a great battle that destroyed many beings. Vaishampayana, a disciple of Vyasa, then began to recite the account of the ancient quarrel between the Kurus and the Pandavas.

The text describes how the Pandavas, who were skilled in archery and knowledge of the Vedas, were oppressed by their cousins, the Kauravas. However, they were protected by fate and destiny, and eventually, they killed Duryodhana and his allies in a great battle.

Janamejaya asked Vaishampayana to tell him more about the story, and Vaishampayana explained that the Mahabharata is a sacred history that contains 100,000 sacred shlokas. It is said to be equal to the Vedas and is considered a purana worshipped by the rishis.

The text then describes how King Uparichara of Chedi was blessed by Indra and became a great king who ruled his kingdom with righteousness. His sons were also great warriors, and one of them, Brihadratha, was instated as the king of Magadha.

The text also describes the birth of various characters in the Mahabharata, including Duryodhana, Karna, and Arjuna. It explains how they were born from different gods and goddesses, and how they played important roles in the great battle between the Kurus and the Pandavas.

Finally, the text describes how the earth was invaded by demons who oppressed all beings, and how Brahma appointed the gods to be born on earth to free it from this burden. The gods accepted their task and went to Vaikuntha to be incarnated.
