Summary of Bhumi parva (under Bhishma parva)

**Summary**

Dhritarashtra asks Sanjaya to describe the geography of Jambudvipa and its surrounding dvipas. Sanjaya describes the mountain of Jambu, which extends over 18,000 yojanas, and the salty ocean that surrounds it. He then describes Shakadvipa, which is double the size of Jambudvipa and surrounded by the milky ocean. The people who live in Shakadvipa are said to be endowed with forgiveness and energy.

Sanjaya continues to describe the dvipas to the north, including Kushadvipa, Shalmalidvipa, and Krounchadvipa. Each of these dvipas is described as being double the size of the previous one, and they are surrounded by mountains on all sides. Sanjaya also describes the countries that are located in each of these dvipas, including Kushala, Manonuga, Ushna, and others.

Dhritarashtra asks Sanjaya to tell him about Rahu, the moon, and the sun, which Sanjaya does by describing their dimensions. He says that the planet Svarbhanu (Rahu) is spherical with a diameter of 12,000 yojanas, while the moon has a diameter of 11,000 yojanas and the sun has a diameter of 10,000 yojanas.
