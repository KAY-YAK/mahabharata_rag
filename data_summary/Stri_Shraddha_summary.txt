Vasudeva tells Gandhari that her son Duryodhana's actions led to the destruction of the Kurus and she should not sorrow unnecessarily. He criticizes her for honoring Duryodhana's evil deeds as virtuous. Vasudeva advises against excessive grief, saying it causes a double calamity.

Rajarshi Dhritarashtra asks Yudhishthira about the number of soldiers killed in the battle. Yudhishthira replies that over 1 billion and 66 million soldiers were slain. Dhritarashtra asks where the brave warriors who died went, and Yudhishthira explains that they have gone to various realms based on their actions during the battle.

Dhritarashtra then asks about the strength of knowledge that allows Yudhishthira to perceive these things. Yudhishthira replies that he obtained this knowledge from devarshi Lomasha and through his own yoga of knowledge.
