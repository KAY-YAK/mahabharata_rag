Summary of Khandava Daha parva (under Adi parva)

**Summary**

The story revolves around the burning of Khandava forest by Agni, the fire god, with the help of Arjuna and Krishna. The forest was protected by Indra, but Agni's flames were so powerful that they could not be extinguished by Indra's rain. Many beings lived in the forest, including serpents, birds, and animals, which were all consumed by the fire.

Agni had promised Mandapala, a sage, to spare his four sons who were living in the forest as Sharngakas. The sons, Jaritari, Sarisrikva, Stambamitra, and Drona, addressed Agni and praised him for his power and benevolence. Agni was pleased with their praise and decided to spare them.

Meanwhile, Mandapala was worried about his sons and went to the forest to find out if they were safe. He met Jarita, their mother, who had also come back to the forest after seeing that her sons were well. However, when Mandapala asked his sons to greet him, they did not respond.

Jarita scolded Mandapala for abandoning them and going away with Lapita, another woman. Mandapala explained that he was anxious about their safety and had spoken to Agni on their behalf. Agni had promised to spare them, and Mandapala's anxiety was unnecessary.

The fire eventually consumed the Khandava forest, and Arjuna and Krishna were granted boons by Indra for their help in burning the forest. Arjuna asked for Shakra's weapons, which would be given to him when Mahadeva was pleased with him. Vasudeva asked for the boon of always being loving towards Partha.
