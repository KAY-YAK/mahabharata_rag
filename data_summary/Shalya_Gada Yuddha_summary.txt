Summary of Gada Yuddha parva (under Shalya parva)

**Summary**

The text describes the scene after Duryodhana's defeat by the bards. He is lying on the ground, covered in dust and blood. His son Ashvatthama and other warriors arrive at the scene and are shocked to see his condition. Duryodhana's son speaks to Kripa and others about his father's death, saying that everything in life is temporary and even kings can fall. He tells them not to be sad about his death because he has obtained eternal worlds through good fortune and the guidance of Krishna.
