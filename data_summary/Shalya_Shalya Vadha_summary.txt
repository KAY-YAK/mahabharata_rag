Summary of Shalya Vadha parva (under Shalya parva)

**Summary**

The great warrior Shalya fought against Bhima in a fierce battle, but both warriors fell down severely injured. Meanwhile, Duryodhana led the charge against the Pandavas, and his soldiers clashed with theirs in a fierce battle. Many soldiers were killed or wounded, including Chekitana, who was pierced by Duryodhana's javelin.

The battle raged on, with both sides determined to emerge victorious. Shalya continued to fight against Yudhishthira but was eventually struck down by Partha (Arjuna). The king of Madra was severely wounded and his chariot wheels were guarded by Chandrasena and Drumasena.

Duryodhana fought with Dhrishtadyumna, who was the slayer of Bharadvaja's son and great in his valour and bravery. Goaded by Duryodhana, three thousand rathas on his side fought Vijaya. The battle was described as "terrible in form" and the warriors were driven by their desire for victory.

The Pandavas could be seen to roam around and attacked Duryodhana's soldiers from every direction, desiring victory. Shalya showered down arrows in every direction, afflicting the Pandavas, including Satyaki and Vrikodara. The king of Madra was single-handedly fighting against many brave ones.

The battle between Yudhishthira and Shalya was intense, with both warriors covered in blood and arrows. They were like tigers fighting over a piece of meat, and their clash was tumultuous and wonderful to behold. In the end, Yudhishthira picked up his javelin and hurled it at Shalya, piercing through his inner organs and broad chest.
