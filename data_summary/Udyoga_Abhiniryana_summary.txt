Summary of Abhiniryana parva (under Udyoga parva)

**Summary**

The text describes a scene from the Mahabharata where Yudhishthira, the eldest Pandava brother, is deciding on a general for their army. He asks his brothers, including Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula, and Sahadeva, to suggest candidates. Each of them nominates someone they think would be suitable: Drupada, Dhrishtadyumna, Shikhandi, Satyaki, Chekitana, and Bhimasena himself.

Yudhishthira then asks Krishna's opinion, who suggests that the powerful warriors named are all capable and can crush the enemy. However, Yudhishthira decides to follow Krishna's advice and appoints Dhrishtadyumna as their general.

The Pandavas then prepare for war by setting up camp in Kurukshetra, a plain and pleasant spot with plenty of fodder and fuel. They are joined by hundreds of kings, including Virata, Drupada, and Shikhandi, who have come to fight alongside them.

Meanwhile, King Duryodhana, the eldest Kaurava brother, is also preparing for war. He deploys his eleven akshouhinis (armies) and instructs his soldiers on how to prepare for battle.
