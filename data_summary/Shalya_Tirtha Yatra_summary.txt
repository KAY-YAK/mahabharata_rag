Summary of Tirtha Yatra parva (under Shalya parva)

**Summary**

The text describes various stories and legends from Hindu mythology, as told by Vaishampayana to King Janamejaya. The first story is about Kartikeya (also known as Kumara), who becomes the general of the gods' army with the help of his followers, the matrikas. He grants a boon to the gods that he will kill their enemies and advances with his army to protect them from the daityas.

The next story tells about the consecration of Kartikeya as the lord of the tirtha (sacred place) known as Indratirtha, where he bathes and gives away riches to the brahmanas. The text then describes the destruction of Agni by Bhrigu's curse and his subsequent disappearance into a shami tree.

The story continues with the account of Balarama's visit to various tirthas, including Badarapachana, Ramatirtha, Yamunatirtha, Adityatirtha, and Sarasvata. At each place, he bathes, gives away riches, and performs austerities.

The text also describes the story of Jaigishavya, who is a mendicant sage who has attained great success in yoga. Asita-Devala, another sage, tries to follow Jaigishavya's path but is unable to do so due to his own limitations.

The next story tells about the birth of Sarasvata, a son born from the union of the river Sarasvati and the rishi Dadhicha. The text describes how Indra uses the bones of Dadhicha to fashion celestial weapons to defeat the asuras.

The final story is about Kuni-Gargya, a sage who generates a daughter through his mind powers. The daughter grows up to be an ascetic and performs great austerities, but ultimately gives away her hand in marriage to a rishi named Sringavan.
