'Ashtaka asked, "How should a householder act so as to attain the gods? What about mendicants and those who
practise brahmacharya? What about the one who is devoted to the right path after retiring to the forest? Those who
know have many differing views on this."

'Yayati replied, "A successful brahmachari should not be asked to do his preceptor's work and will study when
asked to do so. He will awake first and go to bed after everyone else. He will be soft in speech, not stirred by pride,
devoted to studying and self-controlled. The ancient sacred texts say that when a householder obtains riches according to dharma, he must spend it on sacrifices and give alms and provide food to guests. He should not take
from others what has not been given him. A chief sage who has attained success must live on his own strength in
the forest. He must give to others and never cause them pain. He must be controlled in his food and deeds. The true
mendicant is one who does not depend on any craft for his living. He is always without a home, has control over
his senses and is always free from attachment. He does not live under a roof and travels with little and light belongings. He roams through many regions alone. When there is a night in this world when one has conquered desire and happiness, that is the night when a learned one should become an ascetic. A person who performs good
deeds in the forest frees ten generations that have come before and ten that come after him-counting himself, that
is twenty-one generations."

'Ashtaka asked, "How many kinds of sages are there and how many who observe vows of silence? Tell us. We
wish to hear all this from you."

'Yayati replied, "He is a true sage who lives in the forest and turns his back on the village. He is also one who
lives in the village and turns his back on the forest."

'Ashtaka asked, "How can one turn one's back on the village while living in the forest, or turn one's back on the
forest while living in the village?"

'Yayati replied, "The sage who lives in the forest uses nothing from the village. Thus he turns his back on the
village while living in the forest. But a true sage who maintains no fire and has no house or clan and keeps roaming, who wants nothing more than a loincloth as a garment and who is content with food that is enough to sustain
life, he lives in the village and turns his back to the forest. He has given up all desire and deeds[That is, ritualistic deeds.] and has his
senses under complete control. He is the one who attains success in this world as a sage. Who will not worship one
whose teeth are washed, nails are clipped, who is always bathed and without dirt and whose deeds are white,
though he may be dark in complexion[None of this is to be interpreted in a literal sense. For instance, the teeth are clean because he lives on pure
food, the nails are clipped because he does not hurt anyone, he is always bathed and without dirt because his actions are pure and his deeds are white because they are good.]? Lean from austerities and emaciated in blood, flesh and bones, such a
sage not only conquers this world, but also the supreme one. The sage who observes a vow of silence and sits in
meditation, with indifference between opposites[Pain and pleasure, happiness and unhappiness, and so on.], he conquers this world and the supreme world. A sage who
eats like cattle and other animals[Cattle and other animals eat to survive, without making eating the end object.], all his earlier worlds merge with the eternal at the time of universal destruction."'
