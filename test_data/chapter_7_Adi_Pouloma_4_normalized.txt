Souti said, 'Being thus cursed by Bhrigu, the angry Agni said, "O Brahmana! What do you mean by displaying
this rashness today? I always try to stick to the righteous path and tell the truth impartially. On being asked, I told
the truth. Where is my transgression? A witness who is asked and knows the facts, but testifies to that which is
false, dooms both his ancestors and his descendants for seven generations. And he who knows the truth about an
action, but knowingly does not speak, is certainly tainted by the same sin. I am also capable of cursing you, but I
hold Brahmanas in esteem. O Brahmana! Although these are known to you, I shall nevertheless recount them to
you. Listen. Having multiplied myself through my powers of yoga, I am present in many forms, in
agnihotras[Maintenance of the special fire (Agni) and the offering of oblations to it.],sattras[Sacrifices or oblations in general.] and other sacrifices and rituals. When ghee is offered to me in accordance with the rituals
prescribed in the Vedas, the gods and also the ancestors appear in it and are satisfied. The gods are the waters and
the ancestors are also the waters. The gods and the ancestors have equal rights to perform darshas[Sacrifices on the day of the new moon.] and pournamasas[Sacrifices on the day of the full moon.]. Therefore, the gods are the ancestors and the ancestors are the gods. Depending on the stage of the
moon, they are worshipped as one and also separately. The gods and the ancestors eat what is poured on me. I am
therefore known as the mouth of the thirty-three gods[There were originally thirty-three gods-eleven in heaven, eleven in the sky and eleven on earth. Another
way of getting the number is by adding twelve adityas, eleven rudras and ten vishvadevas.] and the ancestors. On the day of the new moon the ancestors, and on the day of the full moon the gods, are fed through my mouth the ghee that is offered to me. If I am
their mouth, how can I become an omnivore?" After contemplating this problem for some time, Agni withdrew
himself from everywhere, from the agnihotras of the Brahmanas, from sattras and other sacrifices. Being deprived
of omkaras, vashatkaras[Exclamations made at the time of offering oblations.],svadhas[Oblations offered to ancestors.] and svahas[Exclamations made at the time of offering oblations.], all the creatures became miserable.

'Then, in great anxiety, the sages went to the gods and said the following words. "O faultless beings! Because of
the loss of fire, the three worlds are confounded at having lost their sacrifices. Without losing any more time,
please decree what is to be done." The gods and the sages then went before Brahma. They told him about the curse
on Agni and his withdrawal from all sacrifices. They said, "O illustrious one! Agni has been cursed by Bhrigu for
some unknown reason. How can he who is the mouth of the gods and receives the first part of all sacrificial offerings and is also the acceptor of all offerings in all the worlds ever become an omnivore?" Having heard all this, the
creator of the world summoned Agni to his presence. He addressed Agni, who is the creator of all the worlds, like
him, and is also eternal, in gentle words. "You are the creator of all the worlds and you are their destroyer. You preserve the three worlds and ensure that all sacrifices and ceremonies are preserved. Therefore, O lord of the worlds!
Act in a way that the rites thrive. O eater of the sacrificial ghee! How have you become thus deluded? You are always pure in this universe. You are the refuge of all living creatures. With your entire body, you cannot become an
omnivore. O Fire, with a crest of flames! Only flames that are meant for accepting oblations will devour everything. Just as everything touched by the sun's rays are rendered pure, anything that has been burnt in your flames
will become pure. O Agni! You are the supreme energy. You have issued forth from your own energy. Through
your own lustrous power, make the sage's curse come true. Accept the gods' share, and your own, when they are
offered into your mouth." Agni replied to the grandfather, "Let it be that way." He went away to obey the instructions of the god Parameshthin[Brahma's epithet.]. In great delight, the gods and the sages returned the way they had come. And the
sages continued to perform all their sacrifices and ceremonies, as they had done before. The gods rejoiced in heaven, as did the many living beings on earth. Freed from the taint of the curse, Agni was also extremely happy. Such
is the ancient history of the curse that was imposed on Agni, with the destruction of Puloman and the birth of
Chyavana.'
